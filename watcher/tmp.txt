    AB  - BACKGROUND: Immunotherapy in combination with chemotherapy has
          shown promising efficacy across many different tumour types. We
          report the prespecified second interim overall survival analysis of
          the phase 3 IMpassion130 study assessing the efficacy and safety of
          atezolizumab plus nab-paclitaxel in patients with unresectable,
          locally advanced or metastatic triple-negative breast cancer.
    AB  - METHODS: In this randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind,
          phase 3 trial, done in 246 academic centres and community oncology
          practices in 41 countries, patients aged 18 years or older, with
          previously untreated, histologically documented, locally advanced or
          metastatic triple-negative breast cancer, and Eastern Cooperative
          Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1 were eligible. Patients
          were randomly assigned (1:1) using a permuted block method (block
          size of four) and an interactive voice-web response system.
          Randomisation was stratified by previous taxane use, liver
          metastases, and PD-L1 expression on tumour-infiltrating immune
          cells. Patients received atezolizumab 840 mg or matching placebo
          intravenously on day 1 and day 15 of every 28-day cycle and
          nab-paclitaxel 100 mg/m2 of body surface area intravenously on days
          1, 8, and 15 until progression or unacceptable toxicity.
          Investigators, patients, and the funder were masked to treatment
          assignment. Coprimary endpoints were investigator-assessed
          progression-free survival per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid
          Tumors version 1.1 and overall survival, assessed in the
          intention-to-treat population and in patients with PD-L1 immune
          cell-positive tumours (tumours with >=1% PD-L1 expression). The
          final progression-free survival results were previously reported at
          the first interim overall survival analysis. The prespecified
          statistical testing hierarchy meant that overall survival in the
          subgroup of PD-L1 immune cell-positive patients could only be
          formally tested if overall survival was significantly different
          between the treatment groups in the intention-to-treat population.
          This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02425891.
    AB  - FINDINGS: Between June 23, 2015, and May 24, 2017, 902
          patients were enrolled, of whom 451 were randomly assigned to
          receive atezolizumab plus nab-paclitaxel and 451 were assigned to
          receive placebo plus nab-paclitaxel (the intention-to-treat
          population). Six patients from each group did not receive treatment.
          At the second interim analysis (data cutoff Jan 2, 2019), median
          follow-up was 18.5 months (IQR 9.6-22.8) in the atezolizumab group
          and 17.5 months (8.4-22.4) in the placebo group. Median overall
          survival in the intention-to-treat patients was 21.0 months (95% CI
          19.0-22.6) with atezolizumab and 18.7 months (16.9-20.3) with
          placebo (stratified hazard ratio [HR] 0.86, 95% CI 0.72-1.02,
          p=0.078). In the exploratory overall survival analysis in patients
          with PD-L1 immune cell-positive tumours, median overall survival was
          25.0 months (95% CI 19.6-30.7) with atezolizumab versus 18.0 months
          (13.6-20.1) with placebo (stratified HR 0.71, 0.54-0.94]). As of
          Sept 3, 2018 (the date up to which updated safety data were
          available), the most common grade 3-4 adverse events were
          neutropenia (38 [8%] of 453 patients in the atezolizumab group vs 36
          [8%] of 437 patients in the placebo group), peripheral neuropathy
          (25 [6%] vs 12 [3%]), decreased neutrophil count (22 [5%] vs 16
          [4%]), and fatigue (17 [4%] vs 15 [3%]). Treatment-related deaths
          occurred in two (<1%) patients in the atezolizumab group (autoimmune
          hepatitis related to atezolizumab [n=1] and septic shock related to
          nab-paclitaxel [n=1]) and one (<1%) patient in the placebo group
          (hepatic failure). No new treatment-related deaths have been
          reported since the primary clinical data cutoff date (April 17,
          2018).
    AB  - INTERPRETATION: Consistent with the first interim analysis,
          this second interim overall survival analysis of IMpassion130
          indicates no significant difference in overall survival between the
          treatment groups in the intention-to-treat population but suggests a
          clinically meaningful overall survival benefit with atezolizumab
          plus nab-paclitaxel in patients with PD-L1 immune cell-positive
          disease. However, this positive result could not be formally tested
          due to the prespecified statistical testing hierarchy. For patients
          with PD-L1 immune cell-positive metastatic triple-negative breast
          cancer, atezolizumab plus nab-paclitaxel is an important therapeutic
          option in a disease with high unmet need.

    AB  - BACKGROUND: Atezolizumab is an inhibitor of PD-L1, which can
          lead to enhanced anticancer T-cell activity. We aimed to evaluate
          the safety, pharmacokinetics, and activity of atezolizumab in
          children and young adults with refractory or relapsed solid tumours,
          with known or expected PD-L1 expression.
    AB  - METHODS: iMATRIX was a multicentre, open-label, phase 1-2
          trial of patients (aged <30 years) with solid tumours or lymphomas
          recruited from 28 hospitals in ten countries (USA, France, Italy,
          UK, Spain, the Netherlands, Denmark, Israel, Switzerland, and
          Germany). Eligible patients younger than 18 years received 15 mg/kg
          atezolizumab (maximum 1200 mg); patients aged 18-29 years received
          the adult dose (1200 mg) until disease progression or loss of
          clinical benefit. Co-primary endpoints were safety (assessed by
          incidence of adverse events) and pharmacokinetics (assessed by serum
          atezolizumab concentrations). Secondary endpoints included the
          proportion of patients achieving an objective response. This trial
          is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02541604.
    AB  - FINDINGS: Between Nov 5, 2015, and April 2, 2018, we screened
          115 patients, 25 of whom did not meet the inclusion criteria. 90
          patients, with a median age of 14 years (IQR 10-17), were enrolled.
          At the data cutoff (April 2, 2018), two patients remained on study
          treatment. 87 (97%) of 90 patients received at least one dose of
          atezolizumab at 15 mg/kg or 1200 mg and were evaluable for safety.
          Three patients were not treated owing to either poor clinical
          condition or withdrawal of consent. In the safety-evaluable
          population (n=87), the most common adverse events were pyrexia (36
          [41%] patients) and fatigue (31 [36%]). The most common grade 3-4
          adverse event was anaemia (19 [22%] patients). The most commonly
          reported serious adverse events were in the categories of infections
          and infestations; pyrexia was the only serious adverse event
          reported in more than two patients. 57 (66%) patients had at least
          one treatment-related adverse event (grade 1-4); fatigue was the
          most common treatment-related adverse event (17 patients [20%]).
          There were no fatal adverse events. Mean serum concentrations of
          atezolizumab were overlapping and comparable between children
          receiving 15 mg/kg and young adults receiving 1200 mg of
          atezolizumab every 3 weeks. Serum concentrations of atezolizumab
          were above the target exposure level in all patients. At 6 months,
          four patients (5%) achieved an objective response (all partial
          responses).
    AB  - INTERPRETATION: Although response to atezolizumab was
          restricted, atezolizumab was well tolerated with generally
          comparable exposure across populations. Our findings might help to
          define future development strategies for immune checkpoint
          inhibitors either by focusing research to specific disease
          subpopulations that exhibit greater benefit from immune checkpoint
          inhibitors, or by providing the means to identify therapeutic
          combination partners that augment T-cell infiltration and
          proliferation in so-called immune cold tumour microenvironments.

    AB  - Aim: To estimate the comparative efficacy of nivolumab +/-
          ipilimumab versus alternative treatments for small-cell lung cancer
          after at least one prior line of chemotherapy. Materials & m ethods:
          A systematic literature review identified six randomized controlled
          trials (RCTs) that could be connected in a network. The Kaplan-Meier
          survival curves from these RCTs were synthesized using network
          meta-analysis models. Aggregate-level matching was used to connect
          CheckMate 032 to the RCTs. Results: CheckMate 032 was connected to
          the network by Amrubicin Clinical Trial-1. Nivolumab +/- ipilimumab
          had a more durable tumor response and more favorable long-term
          survival versus topotecan via intravenous and versus amrubicin.
          Conclusion:  Compared with chemotherapies for recurrent small-cell
          lung cancer, nivolumab +/- ipilimumab improves response duration,
          which may translate to long-term survival benefits.

    AB  - As part of its Single Technology Appraisal (STA) process, the
          National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) invited the
          manufacturer (Merck Sharp & Dohme) of pembrolizumab (Keytruda R) to
          submit evidence of its clinical and cost effectiveness for the
          treatment of locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer where
          cisplatin is unsuitable. The School of Health and Related Research
          Technology Appraisal Group at the University of Sheffield was
          commissioned to act as the independent Evidence Review Group (ERG).
          The ERG produced a detailed review of the evidence for the clinical
          and cost effectiveness of the technology, based on the company's
          submission (CS) to NICE. The clinical effectiveness evidence in the
          CS for pembrolizumab was based on one phase II, single-arm,
          open-label, non-randomised study (KEYNOTE-052), while the evidence
          for the comparator (carboplatin plus gemcitabine) was based on four
          studies, including one randomised controlled trial and three cohort
          studies. In the absence of head-to-head trials, the company
          conducted an indirect treatment comparison for both progression-free
          survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS), by firstly adjusting
          cross-study differences using a simulated treatment comparison
          approach and then synthesizing the evidence based on an assumption
          of constant hazard ratios using a standard meta-analysis model and
          time-varying hazard ratios using fractional polynomial models. The
          treatment effect of pembrolizumab was more favourable in the
          adjusted population compared with the observed effect in the
          KEYNOTE-052 study. The company submitted a de novo partitioned
          survival cohort simulation model, which partitions the OS time into
          PFS and post-progression survival. The probabilistic incremental
          cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for pembrolizumab compared with
          carboplatin plus gemcitabine was estimated to be 37,081 per
          quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained, based on the results
          within the company's health economic model. Following a critique of
          the model, for their preferred base case the ERG corrected some
          minor model errors, chose a progression approach for estimating
          utilities, and revised the extrapolation of PFS and OS. The ERG's
          probabilistic base case ICER was estimated to be 67,068 per QALY
          gained. The ERG also undertook a range of exploratory sensitivity
          analyses which suggested that the ICER was highly uncertain. In
          particular, the choices of extrapolation for the OS of pembrolizumab
          and the stopping rule for pembrolizumab had the largest impacts on
          the ICER. The NICE Appraisal Committee recommended pembrolizumab for
          use within the Cancer Drugs Fund as an option for treating locally
          advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma in adults who have had
          platinum-containing chemotherapy, provided that pembrolizumab was
          stopped at 2 years of uninterrupted treatment, or earlier if the
          disease progresses, and the conditions of the managed access
          agreement for pembrolizumab are followed.

    AB  - PURPOSE: Metastatic mucosal melanoma responds poorly to
          anti-programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) monotherapy. Vascular
          endothelial growth factor (VEGF) has been shown to play an important
          immunosuppressive role in the tumor microenvironment. The
          combination of VEGF inhibition and PD-1 blockade provides
          therapeutic opportunities for patients refractory to either therapy
          alone.
    AB  - PATIENTS AND METHODS: We conducted a single-center, phase IB
          trial evaluating the safety and preliminary efficacy of toripalimab,
          a humanized immunoglobulin G4 monoclonal antibody against PD-1 in
          combination with the VEGF receptor inhibitor axitinib in patients
          with advanced melanoma, including patients with chemotherapy-naive
          mucosal melanomas (88%). Patients received toripalimab at 1 or 3
          mg/kg via intravenous infusion every 2 weeks, in combination with
          axitinib 5 mg orally twice a day, in a dose-escalation and
          cohort-expansion study until confirmed disease progression,
          unacceptable toxicity, or voluntary withdrawal. The primary
          objective was safety. Secondary objectives included efficacy,
          pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, immunogenicity, and tumor tissue
          biomarkers.
    AB  - RESULTS: Thirty-three patients were enrolled. No dose-limiting
          toxicities were observed. Ninety-seven percent of patients
          experienced treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs). The most
          common TRAEs were mild (grade 1 or 2) and included diarrhea,
          proteinuria, hand and foot syndrome, fatigue, AST or ALT elevation,
          hypertension, hypo- or hyperthyroidism, and rash. Grade 3 or greater
          TRAEs occurred in 39.4% of patients. By the cutoff date, among 29
          patients with chemotherapy-naive mucosal melanoma, 14 patients
          (48.3%; 95% CI, 29.4% to 67.5%) achieved objective response, and the
          median progression-free survival time was 7.5 months (95% CI, 3.7
          months to not reached) per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid
          Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1.
    AB  - CONCLUSION: The combination of toripalimab plus axitinib was
          tolerable and showed promising antitumor activity in patients with
          treatment-naive metastatic mucosal melanoma. Patients enrolled in
          this study were all Asian, and this combination therapy must be
          validated in a randomized phase III trial that includes a non-Asian
          population before it can become a standard of care.

    AB  - BACKGROUND: Little is known about tumor-associated vasogenic
          edema in brain metastasis, yet it causes significant morbidity and
          mortality. Our purpose was to characterize edema in patients treated
          with anti-PD-1 and to study potential causes of vessel leakage in
          humans and in pre-clinical models.
    AB  - METHODS: We analyzed tumor and edema volume in 18 non-small
          cell lung (NSCLC) and 18 melanoma patients with untreated brain
          metastases treated with pembrolizumab on a phase II clinical trial.
          Melanoma brain metastases were stained with anti-CD34 to assess
          vessel density and its association with edema. We employed an in
          vitro model of the blood-brain barrier using short-term cultures
          from melanoma brain and extracranial metastases to determine tight
          junction resistance as a measure of vessel leakiness.
    AB  - RESULTS: Edema volumes are similar in NSCLC and melanoma brain
          metastases. While larger tumors tended to have more edema, the
          correlation was weak (R2 = 0.30). Patients responding to
          pembrolizumab had concurrent shrinkage of edema volume and vice
          versa (R2 = 0.81). Vessel density was independent of the degree of
          edema (R2 = 0.037). Melanoma brain metastasis cells in culture
          caused loss of tight junction resistance in an in vitro blood-brain
          barrier model system in some cases, whereas extracerebral cell
          cultures did not.
    AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Edema itself should not preclude using anti-PD-1
          with caution, as sensitive tumors have resultant decreases in edema,
          and anti-PD-1 itself does not exacerbate edema in sensitive tumors.
          Additional factors aside from tumor mass effect and vessel density
          cause perilesional edema. Melanoma cells themselves can cause
          decline in tight junction resistance in a system void of immune
          cells, suggesting they secrete factors that cause leakiness, which
          might be harnessed for pharmacologic targeting in patients with
          significant perilesional edema.

    AB  - BACKGROUND: Strategies to improve activity of immune
          checkpoint inhibitors are needed. We hypothesized enhanced DNA
          damage by olaparib, a PARP inhibitor, and reduced VEGF signaling by
          cediranib, a VEGFR1-3 inhibitor, would complement anti-tumor
          activity of durvalumab, a PD-L1 inhibitor, and the 3-drug
          combination would be tolerable.
    AB  - METHODS: This phase 1 study tested the 3-drug combination in a
          3 + 3 dose escalation. Cediranib was taken intermittently (5 days
          on/2 days off) at 15 or 20 mg (dose levels 1 and 2, respectively)
          with durvalumab 1500 mg IV every 4 weeks, and olaparib tablets 300
          mg twice daily. The primary end point was the recommended phase 2
          dose (RP2D). Response rate, pharmacokinetic (PK), and correlative
          analyses were secondary endpoints.
    AB  - RESULTS: Nine patients (7 ovarian/1 endometrial/1 triple
          negative breast cancers, median 3 prior therapies [2-6]) were
          treated. Grade 3/4 adverse events include hypertension (1/9), anemia
          (1/9) and lymphopenia (3/9). No patients experienced dose limiting
          toxicities. The RP2D is cediranib, 20 mg (5 days on/2 days off) with
          full doses of durvalumab and olaparib. Four patients had partial
          responses (44%) and 3 had stable disease lasting >=6 months,
          yielding a 67% clinical benefit rate. No significant effects on
          olaparib or cediranib PK parameters from the presence of durvalumab,
          or the co-administration of cediranib or olaparib were identified.
          Tumoral PD-L1 expression correlated with clinical benefit but
          cytokines and peripheral immune subsets did not.
    AB  - CONCLUSIONS: The RP2D is tolerable and has preliminary
          activity in recurrent women's cancers. A phase 2 expansion study is
          now enrolling for recurrent ovarian cancer patients.

    AB  - BACKGROUND: IMspire150 aimed to evaluate first-line
          combination treatment with BRAF plus MEK inhibitors and immune
          checkpoint therapy in BRAFV600 mutation-positive advanced or
          metastatic melanoma.
    AB  - METHODS: IMspire150 was a randomised, double-blind,
          placebo-controlled phase 3 study done at 112 institutes in 20
          countries. Patients with unresectable stage IIIc-IV, BRAFV600
          mutation-positive melanoma were randomly assigned 1:1 to 28-day
          cycles of atezolizumab, vemurafenib, and cobimetinib (atezolizumab
          group) or atezolizumab placebo, vemurafenib, and cobimetinib
          (control group). In cycle 1, all patients received vemurafenib and
          cobimetinib only; atezolizumab placebo was added from cycle 2
          onward. Randomisation was stratified by lactate dehydrogenase
          concentration and geographical region. Blinding for atezolizumab was
          achieved by means of an identical intravenous placebo, and blinding
          for vemurafenib was achieved by means of a placebo tablet. The
          primary outcome was investigator-assessed progression-free survival.
          This trial (ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02908672) is ongoing but no
          longer recruiting patients.
    AB  - FINDINGS: Between Jan 13, 2017, and April 26, 2018, 777
          patients were screened and 514 were enrolled and randomly assigned
          to the atezolizumab group (n=256) or control group (n=258). At a
          median follow-up of 18.9 months (IQR 10.4-23.8), progression-free
          survival as assessed by the study investigator was significantly
          prolonged with atezolizumab versus control (15.1 vs 10.6 months;
          hazard ratio [HR] 0.78; 95% CI 0.63-0.97; p=0.025). Common
          treatment-related adverse events (>30%) in the atezolizumab and
          control groups were blood creatinine phosphokinase increased (51.3%
          vs 44.8%), diarrhoea (42.2% vs 46.6%), rash (40.9%, both groups),
          arthralgia (39.1% vs 28.1%), pyrexia (38.7% vs 26.0%), alanine
          aminotransferase increased (33.9% vs 22.8%), and lipase increased
          (32.2% vs 27.4%); 13% of patients in the atezolizumab group and 16%
          in the control group stopped all treatment because of adverse
          events.
    AB  - INTERPRETATION: The addition of atezolizumab to targeted
          therapy with vemurafenib and cobimetinib was safe and tolerable and
          significantly increased progression-free survival in patients with
          BRAFV600 mutation-positive advanced melanoma.

    AB  - BACKGROUND: This analysis compared quality-adjusted time
          without symptoms of disease progression or toxicity (Q-TWiST)
          between nivolumab and everolimus among previously treated patients
          with advanced renal cell carcinoma enrolled in the phase III
          CheckMate 025 trial (NCT01668784).
    AB  - MATERIALS AND METHODS: At 45-month follow-up, overall survival
          (OS) was partitioned into 3 health states: TWiST, time with grade >=
          3 toxicity (TOX), and time after progression (REL). Mean Q-TWiST was
          determined by multiplying each state's duration with its utility
          (TWiST, 1.0; TOX, 0.5; REL, 0.5). Relative Q-TWiST gains (calculated
          as Q-TWiST difference divided by everolimus OS) of >= 10% were
          predefined as clinically important. Immuno-oncology-specific
          sensitivity analyses considered 4 alternative progression
          definitions: Tumor size increase >= 25% from nadir; treatment
          discontinuation; >= 2-point reduction from baseline in Functional
          Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Kidney Symptom Index Disease-Related
          Symptoms scores; and a composite definition. A scenario
          incorporating grade >= 2 toxicities was tested.
    AB  - RESULTS: Compared with everolimus, nivolumab was associated
          with a significant Q-TWiST improvement of 3.3 months (P < .001). In
          all sensitivity analyses, nivolumab was associated with Q-TWiST
          gains (relative gain %) ranging from 3.3 months (14.4%) to 4.8
          months (20.9%).
    AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Nivolumab is associated with a statistically
          significant and clinically meaningful gain in quality-adjusted OS
          versus everolimus among previously treated patients with advanced
          renal cell carcinoma. Copyright &#xa9; 2019 The Authors. Published

    AB  - BACKGROUND: Advanced recurrent ovarian cancer (ROC) is the
          leading cause of gynecologic cancer-related death in developed
          countries and new treatments are needed. Previous studies of immune
          checkpoint blockade showed low objective response rates (ORR) in ROC
          with no identified predictive biomarker.
    AB  - PATIENTS AND METHODS: This phase II study of pembrolizumab
          (NCT02674061) examined two patient cohorts with ROC: cohort A
          received one to three prior lines of treatment with a platinum-free
          interval (PFI) or treatment-free interval (TFI) between 3 and 12
          months and cohort B received four to six prior lines with a PFI/TFI
          of >=3 months. Pembrolizumab 200 mg was administered intravenously
          every 3 weeks until cancer progression, toxicity, or completion of 2
          years. Primary end points were ORR by Response Evaluation Criteria
          in Solid Tumors version 1.1 per blinded independent central review
          by cohort and by PD-L1 expression measured as combined positive
          score (CPS). Secondary end points included duration of response
          (DOR), disease control rate (DCR), progression-free survival (PFS),
          overall survival (OS), and safety.
    AB  - RESULTS: Cohort A enrolled 285 patients; the first 100 served
          as the training set for PD-L1 biomarker analysis. Cohort B enrolled
          91 patients. ORR was 7.4% for cohort A and 9.9% for cohort B. Median
          DOR was 8.2 months for cohort A and not reached for cohort B. DCR
          was 37.2% and 37.4%, respectively, in cohorts A and B. Based on the
          training set analysis, CPS 1 and 10 were selected for evaluation in
          the confirmation set. In the confirmation set, ORR was 4.1% for CPS
          <1, 5.7% CPS >=1, and 10.0% for CPS >=10. PFS was 2.1 months for
          both cohorts. Median OS was not reached for cohort A and was 17.6
          months for cohort B. Toxicities were consistent with other
          single-agent pembrolizumab trials.
    AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Single-agent pembrolizumab showed modest activity
          in patients with ROC. Higher PD-L1 expression was correlated with
          higher response.

    AB  - BACKGROUND: Preclinical evidence suggests that MEK inhibition
          promotes accumulation and survival of intratumoral tumor-specific T
          cells and can synergize with immune checkpoint inhibition. We
          investigated the safety and clinical activity of combining a MEK
          inhibitor, cobimetinib, and a programmed cell death 1 ligand 1
          (PD-L1) inhibitor, atezolizumab, in patients with solid tumors.
    AB  - PATIENTS AND METHODS: This phase I/Ib study treated
          PD-L1/PD-1-naive patients with solid tumors in a dose-escalation
          stage and then in multiple, indication-specific dose-expansion
          cohorts. In most patients, cobimetinib was dosed once daily orally
          for 21 days on, 7 days off. Atezolizumab was dosed at 800 mg
          intravenously every 2 weeks. The primary objectives were safety and
          tolerability. Secondary end points included objective response rate,
          progression-free survival, and overall survival.
    AB  - RESULTS: Between 27 December 2013 and 9 May 2016, 152 patients
          were enrolled. As of 4 September 2017, 150 patients received >=1
          dose of atezolizumab, including 14 in the dose-escalation cohorts
          and 136 in the dose-expansion cohorts. Patients had metastatic
          colorectal cancer (mCRC; n = 84), melanoma (n = 22), non-small-cell
          lung cancer (NSCLC; n = 28), and other solid tumors (n = 16). The
          most common all-grade treatment-related adverse events (AEs) were
          diarrhea (67%), rash (48%), and fatigue (40%), similar to those with
          single-agent cobimetinib and atezolizumab. One (<1%)
          treatment-related grade 5 AE occurred (sepsis). Forty-five (30%) and
          23 patients (15%) had AEs that led to discontinuation of cobimetinib
          and atezolizumab, respectively. Confirmed responses were observed in
          7 of 84 patients (8%) with mCRC (6 responders were microsatellite
          low/stable, 1 was microsatellite instable), 9 of 22 patients (41%)
          with melanoma, and 5 of 28 patients (18%) with NSCLC. Clinical
          activity was independent of KRAS/BRAF status across diseases.
    AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Atezolizumab plus cobimetinib had manageable
          safety and clinical activity irrespective of KRAS/BRAF status.
          Although potential synergistic activity was seen in mCRC, this was
          not confirmed in a subsequent phase III study.

    AB  - BACKGROUND: Many high cost treatments for advanced melanoma
          have become available in recent years. National health technology
          assessment agencies have raised concerns regarding uncertainty in
          their clinical and cost-effectiveness.
    AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this systematic review is to identify
          economic evaluations of treatments for advanced melanoma and review
          model assumptions, outcomes, and quality as preparation for a health
          technology assessment.
    AB  - METHODS: A search of Embase, MEDLINE, EconLit, and the
          Cochrane Database was conducted. Only studies using
          decision-analytic models were included. Two authors independently
          completed full-text review and data extraction.
    AB  - RESULTS: Fifteen studies were identified. There were major
          differences in the structural assumptions underpinning the models.
          There was general agreement in study conclusions, although the
          predicted costs and quality-adjusted life years for each treatment
          varied. BRAF monotherapy (vemurafenib, dabrafenib) or BRAF/MEK
          combination therapy (BRAF monotherapy with cobimetinib or
          trametinib) has not been shown to be cost-effective in any
          jurisdiction. PD-1 inhibitors (pembrolizumab, nivolumab) are
          consistently found to be cost-effective compared with ipilimumab,
          although their cost-effectiveness compared with chemotherapy is not
          established. Combination therapy with nivolumab and ipilimumab is
          unlikely to be cost-effective in any setting. One study including
          all agents found that none of the new treatments were cost-effective
          relative to chemotherapy. Publication of the study in a health
          economics journal is associated with better reporting of and
          higher-quality assessment than those published in clinical journals.
    AB  - CONCLUSION: Despite differences in model structures and
          assumptions, the conclusions of most included studies were
          consistent. Health technology assessment has a key role in
          maximizing value from high-cost innovative treatments. Consideration
          should be given to divestment from BRAF/MEK inhibitors and
          ipilimumab in favor of reimbursement of PD-1 inhibitors. Copyright

    AB  - PURPOSE: Patients with relapsed or refractory primary
          mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma (rrPMBCL) have a poor prognosis,
          and their treatment represents an urgent and unmet need. Because
          PMBCL is associated with genetic aberrations at 9p24 and
          overexpression of programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) ligands (PD-L1), it
          is hypothesized to be susceptible to PD-1 blockade.
    AB  - METHODS: In the phase IB KEYNOTE-013 (ClinicalTrials.gov
          identifier: NCT01953692) and phase II KEYNOTE-170
          (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02576990) studies, adults with
          rrPMBCL received pembrolizumab for up to 2 years or until disease
          progression or unacceptable toxicity. The primary end points were
          safety and objective response rate in KEYNOTE-013 and objective
          response rate in KEYNOTE-170. Secondary end points included duration
          of response, progression-free survival, overall survival, and
          safety. Exploratory end points included association between
          biomarkers and pembrolizumab activity.
    AB  - RESULTS: The objective response rate was 48% (7 complete
          responses; 33%) among 21 patients in KEYNOTE-013 and 45% (7 complete
          responses; 13%) among 53 patients in KEYNOTE-170. After a median
          follow-up time of 29.1 months in KEYNOTE-013 and 12.5 months in
          KEYNOTE-170, the median duration of response was not reached in
          either study. No patient with complete response experienced
          progression, including 2 patients with complete response for at
          least 1 year off therapy. Treatment-related adverse events occurred
          in 24% of patients in KEYNOTE-013 and 23% of patients in
          KEYNOTE-170. There were no treatment-related deaths. Among 42
          evaluable patients, the magnitude of the 9p24 gene abnormality was
          associated with PD-L1 expression, which was itself significantly
          associated with progression-free survival.
    AB  - CONCLUSION: Pembrolizumab is associated with high response
          rate, durable activity, and a manageable safety profile in patients
          with rrPMBCL.

    AB  - BACKGROUND: In the ongoing phase 3 CheckMate 214 trial,
          nivolumab plus ipilimumab showed superior efficacy over sunitinib in
          patients with previously untreated intermediate-risk or poor-risk
          advanced renal cell carcinoma, with a manageable safety profile. In
          this study, we aimed to assess efficacy and safety after extended
          follow-up to inform the long-term clinical benefit of nivolumab plus
          ipilimumab versus sunitinib in this setting.
    AB  - METHODS: In the phase 3, randomised, controlled CheckMate 214
          trial, patients aged 18 years and older with previously untreated,
          advanced, or metastatic histologically confirmed renal cell
          carcinoma with a clear-cell component were recruited from 175
          hospitals and cancer centres in 28 countries. Patients were
          categorised by International Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma
          Database Consortium risk status into favourable-risk,
          intermediate-risk, and poor-risk subgroups and randomly assigned
          (1:1) to open-label nivolumab (3 mg/kg intravenously) plus
          ipilimumab (1 mg/kg intravenously) every 3 weeks for four doses,
          followed by nivolumab (3 mg/kg intravenously) every 2 weeks; or
          sunitinib (50 mg orally) once daily for 4 weeks (6-week cycle).
          Randomisation was done through an interactive voice response system,
          with a block size of four and stratified by risk status and
          geographical region. The co-primary endpoints for the trial were
          overall survival, progression-free survival per independent
          radiology review committee (IRRC), and objective responses per IRRC
          in intermediate-risk or poor-risk patients. Secondary endpoints were
          overall survival, progression-free survival per IRRC, and objective
          responses per IRRC in the intention-to-treat population, and adverse
          events in all treated patients. In this Article, we report overall
          survival, investigator-assessed progression-free survival,
          investigator-assessed objective response, characterisation of
          response, and safety after extended follow-up. Efficacy outcomes
          were assessed in all randomly assigned patients; safety was assessed
          in all treated patients. This study is registered with
          ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02231749, and is ongoing but now
          closed to recruitment.
    AB  - FINDINGS: Between Oct 16, 2014, and Feb 23, 2016, of 1390
          patients screened, 1096 (79%) eligible patients were randomly
          assigned to nivolumab plus ipilimumab or sunitinib (550 vs 546 in
          the intention-to-treat population; 425 vs 422 intermediate-risk or
          poor-risk patients, and 125 vs 124 favourable-risk patients). With
          extended follow-up (median follow-up 32.4 months [IQR 13.4-36.3]),
          in intermediate-risk or poor-risk patients, results for the three
          co-primary efficacy endpoints showed that nivolumab plus ipilimumab
          continued to be superior to sunitinib in terms of overall survival
          (median not reached [95% CI 35.6-not estimable] vs 26.6 months
          [22.1-33.4]; hazard ratio [HR] 0.66 [95% CI 0.54-0.80], p<0.0001),
          progression-free survival (median 8.2 months [95% CI 6.9-10.0] vs
          8.3 months [7.0-8.8]; HR 0.77 [95% CI 0.65-0.90], p=0.0014), and the
          proportion of patients achieving an objective response (178 [42%] of
          425 vs 124 [29%] of 422; p=0.0001). Similarly, in intention-to-treat
          patients, nivolumab and ipilimumab showed improved efficacy compared
          with sunitinib in terms of overall survival (median not reached [95%
          CI not estimable] vs 37.9 months [32.2-not estimable]; HR 0.71 [95%
          CI 0.59-0.86], p=0.0003), progression-free survival (median 9.7
          months [95% CI 8.1-11.1] vs 9.7 months [8.3-11.1]; HR 0.85 [95% CI
          0.73-0.98], p=0.027), and the proportion of patients achieving an
          objective response (227 [41%] of 550 vs 186 [34%] of 546 p=0.015).
          In all treated patients, the most common grade 3-4 treatment-related
          adverse events in the nivolumab and ipilimumab group were increased
          lipase (57 [10%] of 547), increased amylase (31 [6%]), and increased
          alanine aminotransferase (28 [5%]), whereas in the sunitinib group
          they were hypertension (90 [17%] of 535), fatigue (51 [10%]), and
          palmar-plantar erythrodysaesthesia (49 [9%]). Eight deaths in the
          nivolumab plus ipilimumab group and four deaths in the sunitinib
          group were reported as treatment-related.
    AB  - INTERPRETATION: The results suggest that the superior efficacy
          of nivolumab plus ipilimumab over sunitinib was maintained in
          intermediate-risk or poor-risk and intention-to-treat patients with
          extended follow-up, and show the long-term benefits of nivolumab
          plus ipilimumab in patients with previously untreated advanced renal
          cell carcinoma across all risk categories.

    AB  - BACKGROUND: Checkpoint inhibitor therapy is a standard of care
          for patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma. Treatment options
          after checkpoint inhibitor therapy include vascular endothelial
          growth factor receptor (VEGF-R) tyrosine kinase inhibitors, although
          no prospective data regarding their use in this setting exist.
          Axitinib is a VEGF-R inhibitor with clinical data supporting
          increased activity with dose titration. We aimed to investigate the
          activity of dose titrated axitinib in patients with metastatic renal
          cell carcinoma who were previously treated with checkpoint
          inhibitor.
    AB  - METHODS: We did a multicentre, phase 2 trial of axitinib given
          on an individualised dosing algorithm. Patients at least 18 years of
          age with histologically or cytologically confirmed locally recurrent
          or metastatic renal cell carcinoma with clear cell histology, a
          Karnofsky Performance Status of 70% or more, and measurable disease
          who received checkpoint inhibitor therapy as the most recent
          treatment were eligible. There was no limit on number of previous
          therapies received. Patients received oral axitinib at a starting
          dose of 5 mg twice daily with dose titration every 14 days in 1 mg
          increments (ie, 5 mg twice daily to 6 mg twice daily, up to 10 mg
          twice daily maximum dose) if there was no axitinib-related grade 2
          or higher mucositis, diarrhoea, hand-foot syndrome, or fatigue. If
          one or more of these grade 2 adverse events occurred, axitinib was
          withheld for 3 days before the same dose was resumed. Dose
          reductions were made if recurrent grade 2 adverse events despite
          treatment breaks or grade 3-4 adverse events occurred. The primary
          outcome was progression-free survival. Analyses were done per
          protocol in all patients who received at least one dose of axitinib.
          Recruitment has been completed and the trial is ongoing. This trial
          is registered with ClincalTrials.gov, number NCT02579811.
    AB  - FINDINGS: Between Jan 5, 2016 and Feb 21, 2018, 40 patients
          were enrolled and received at least one dose of study treatment.
          With a median follow-up of 8.7 months (IQR 3.7-14.2), the median
          progression-free survival was 8.8 months (95% CI 5.7-16.6). Fatigue
          (83%) and hypertension (75%) were the most common all-grade adverse
          events. The most common grade 3 adverse event was hypertension (24
          patients [60%]). There was one (3%) grade 4 adverse event (elevated
          lipase) and no treatment-related deaths occurred. Serious adverse
          events that were likely related to therapy occurred in eight (20%)
          patients; the most common were dehydration (n=4) and diarrhoea
          (n=2).
    AB  - INTERPRETATION: Individualised axitinib dosing in patients
          with metastatic renal cell inoma previously treated with checkpoint
          inhibitors did not meet the prespecified threshold for progression
          free survival, but these data show that this individualised
          titration scheme is feasible and has robust clinical activity. These
          prospective results warrant consideration of axitinib in this
          setting.

    AB  - Lung cancer resulted in an estimated 1.8 million deaths
          worldwide in 2018 and approximately 20% of patients with non-small
          cell lung cancer (NSCLC) are diagnosed with stage III unresectable
          disease. Phase III data from the PACIFIC trial show significantly
          improved progression-free survival for the checkpoint-inhibitor
          durvalumab given as consolidation following definitive
          chemoradiotherapy (cCRT). Overall survival results from this study
          have now been reported, along with outcomes from other phase II
          trials. A thorough review of the efficacy and safety of
          checkpoint-inhibitors used in conjunction with cCRT for stage III
          unresectable NSCLC is needed. Published and presented literature on
          phase II and III data was identified using the key search terms
          "non-small cell lung cancer" AND "checkpoint-inhibitors" (OR
          respective aliases). One randomized phase III clinical trial and
          three phase II trials reporting outcomes of checkpoint-inhibitors in
          conjunction with cCRT for stage III unresectable NSCLC were
          identified. PACIFIC reported significantly improved overall survival
          for consolidation durvalumab following cCRT compared with placebo.
          Although discontinuation due to adverse events (AEs) was higher with
          durvalumab, rates of grade 3/4 pneumonitis or radiation pneumonitis
          were low and comparable between arms. Results from phase II trials
          also show promising activity for other checkpoint-inhibitors and
          alternative sequencing strategies, although these need to be
          confirmed in a randomized context. Preliminary data suggest
          differences in the safety profiles between PD-1 and PD-L1
          inhibitors. Currently, the role of PD-L1 expression levels for
          patient selection in this setting remains unclear, and durvalumab
          should be administered on an individual basis in patients with known
          driver mutations. Consolidation durvalumab following cCRT
          significantly improves overall survival with an acceptable safety
          profile in patients with stage III unresectable NSCLC, now
          representing a new standard of care. Copyright &#xa9; 2019 Elsevier

    AB  - This network meta-analysis (NMA), based on 12 phase-III
          studies with 9,236 metastatic NSCLC patients, aims to compare the
          efficacy of treatments including at least one immune-checkpoint
          inhibitor (ICI) with or without chemotherapy, as frontline therapy
          for advanced NSCLC patients. The NMA includes direct randomized
          evidence on treatments of interest along with indirect evidence from
          randomized studies with chemotherapy as the common comparator.
          Studies were identified by searching PubMed, and the abstracts of
          most recent main oncology congresses. The primary endpoint,
          Hazard-Ratio (HR) of Progression-free Survival (PFS), was estimated
          by a frequentist-approach NMA. Results are presented in the overall
          cohort (all-comers or PD-L1-positive) irrespective of histology, and
          by histology, PD-L1 expression level and sex. According to the
          primary PFS-NMA in the overall cohort, the combination of
          chemotherapy, first with pembrolizumab, second with atezolizumab
          exhibit significantly higher benefit than any other treatment
          examined. This superior PFS benefit is found for both squamous and
          non-squamous patients. Similarly for OS, the combination of
          pembrolizumab/chemotherapy, and
          atezolizumab/bevacizumab/chemotherapy-(ABC), followed by
          pembrolizumab-monotherapy and atezolizumab/chemotherapy, are the
          best treatments in the overall cohort, driven by the non-squamous
          histology. In the PD-L1-high patients again the combination of
          chemotherapy with atezolizumab or pembrolizumab, exhibit significant
          PFS benefit, followed by pembrolizumab-monotherapy. PFS benefit of
          these ICI/chemotherapy combinations are also found in PD-L1-negative
          and PD-L1-intermediate patients(1%<=PD-L1 < 50%). Of note, ABC is
          evaluated only for OS in non-squamous patients while the
          pembrolizumab-monotherapy PFS benefit and the
          atezolizumab/chemotherapy OS benefit are probably under-estimated
          since most of the data stems from non-significant interim analyses
          of ongoing studies [KN042;IM131/132/150]. In conclusion, the
          addition of chemotherapy to ICIs enhanced their treatment efficacy
          as first-line treatment for advanced NSCLC patients. The combination
          of chemotherapy with either pembrolizumab or atezolizumab show
          consistently higher efficacy than chemotherapy-alone or any other
          ICI-combination or monotherapy, particularly in non-squamous
          patients. Copyright &#xa9; 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

    AB  - OBJECTIVES: The efficacy of nivolumab against metastatic
          non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has been demonstrated; however,
          pneumonitis is relatively common and is a potentially
          life-threatening immune-related adverse event. Patients with
          idiopathic interstitial pneumonia (IIP) have a higher risk of
          pneumonitis and are generally excluded from clinical trials.
          Additionally, to date, a multicenter prospective trial for
          previously-treated NSCLC patients with IIP has not been performed.
          To fulfill this unmet medical need, we conducted a multicenter,
          open-label single-arm phase II trial to evaluate the efficacy and
          safety of nivolumab in NSCLC patients with mild IIP.
    AB  - MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eligible patients had
          previously-treated, inoperable NSCLC with mild IIPs. Mild IIP was
          defined as a predicted vital capacity of at least 80% and possible
          usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP) or inconsistent with UIP pattern
          by chest high-resolution computed tomography. Primary end point was
          the 6 months PFS rate and secondary end point was the safety of this
          therapy.
    AB  - RESULTS: Eighteen patients were enrolled in this trial. Six
          months PFS rate was 56%, response rate was 39%, and disease control
          rate was 72%. There were no treatment-related deaths. One
          drug-related grade 3/4 nonhematologic event (grade 3 neurotoxicity)
          was observed. Two patients had grade 2 pneumonitis which improved by
          corticosteroid therapy.
    AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Nivolumab could be an effective therapy for NSCLC
          patients with mild IIPs. Copyright &#xa9; 2019 Elsevier B.V. All

    AB  - BACKGROUND: The outcome of patients with macroscopic stage III
          melanoma is poor. Neoadjuvant treatment with ipilimumab plus
          nivolumab at the standard dosing schedule induced pathological
          responses in a high proportion of patients in two small independent
          early-phase trials, and no patients with a pathological response
          have relapsed after a median follow up of 32 months. However,
          toxicity of the standard ipilimumab plus nivolumab dosing schedule
          was high, preventing its broader clinical use. The aim of the
          OpACIN-neo trial was to identify a dosing schedule of ipilimumab
          plus nivolumab that is less toxic but equally effective.
    AB  - METHODS: OpACIN-neo is a multicentre, open-label, phase 2,
          randomised, controlled trial. Eligible patients were aged at least
          18 years, had a WHO performance status of 0-1, had resectable stage
          III melanoma involving lymph nodes only, and measurable disease
          according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors
          version 1.1. Patients were enrolled from three medical centres in
          Australia, Sweden, and the Netherlands, and were randomly assigned
          (1:1:1), stratified by site, to one of three neoadjuvant dosing
          schedules: group A, two cycles of ipilimumab 3 mg/kg plus nivolumab
          1 mg/kg once every 3 weeks intravenously; group B, two cycles of
          ipilimumab 1 mg/kg plus nivolumab 3 mg/kg once every 3 weeks
          intravenously; or group C, two cycles of ipilimumab 3 mg/kg once
          every 3 weeks directly followed by two cycles of nivolumab 3 mg/kg
          once every 2 weeks intravenously. The investigators, site staff, and
          patients were aware of the treatment assignment during the study
          participation. Pathologists were masked to treatment allocation and
          all other data. The primary endpoints were the proportion of
          patients with grade 3-4 immune-related toxicity within the first 12
          weeks and the proportion of patients achieving a radiological
          objective response and pathological response at 6 weeks. Analyses
          were done in all patients who received at least one dose of study
          drug. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number
          NCT02977052, and is ongoing with an additional extension cohort and
          to complete survival analysis.
    AB  - FINDINGS: Between Nov 24, 2016 and June 28, 2018, 105 patients
          were screened for eligibility, of whom 89 (85%) eligible patients
          were enrolled and randomly assigned to one of the three groups.
          Three patients were excluded after randomisation because they were
          found to be ineligible, and 86 received at least one dose of study
          drug; 30 patients in group A, 30 in group B, and 26 in group C
          (accrual to this group was closed early upon advice of the Data
          Safety Monitoring Board on June 4, 2018 because of severe adverse
          events). Within the first 12 weeks, grade 3-4 immune-related adverse
          events were observed in 12 (40%) of 30 patients in group A, six
          (20%) of 30 in group B, and 13 (50%) of 26 in group C. The
          difference in grade 3-4 toxicity between group B and A was -20% (95%
          CI -46 to 6; p=0.158) and between group C and group A was 10% (-20
          to 40; p=0.591). The most common grade 3-4 adverse events were
          elevated liver enzymes in group A (six [20%)]) and colitis in group
          C (five [19%]); in group B, none of the grade 3-4 adverse events
          were seen in more than one patient. One patient (in group A) died
          9.5 months after the start of treatment due to the consequences of
          late-onset immune-related encephalitis, which was possibly
          treatment-related. 19 (63% [95% CI 44-80]) of 30 patients in group
          A, 17 (57% [37-75]) of 30 in group B, and nine (35% [17-56]) of 26
          in group C achieved a radiological objective response, while
          pathological responses occurred in 24 (80% [61-92]) patients in
          group A, 23 (77% [58-90]) in group B, and 17 (65% [44-83]) in group
          C.
    AB  - INTERPRETATION: OpACIN-neo identified a tolerable neoadjuvant
          dosing schedule (group B: two cycles of ipilimumab 1 mg/kg plus
          nivolumab 3 mg/kg) that induces a pathological response in a high
          proportion of patients and might be suitable for broader clinical
          use. When more mature data confirm these early observations, this
          schedule should be tested in randomised phase 3 studies versus
          adjuvant therapies, which are the current standard-of-care systemic
          therapy for patients with stage III melanoma.

    AB  - BACKGROUND: Atezolizumab (a monoclonal antibody against
          PD-L1), which restores anticancer immunity, improved overall
          survival in patients with previously treated non-small-cell lung
          cancer and also showed clinical benefit when combined with
          chemotherapy as first-line treatment of non-small-cell lung cancer.
          IMpower130 aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of atezolizumab
          plus chemotherapy versus chemotherapy alone as first-line therapy
          for non-squamous non-small-cell lung cancer.
    AB  - METHODS: IMpower130 was a multicentre, randomised, open-label,
          phase 3 study done in 131 centres across eight countries (the USA,
          Canada, Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and Israel).
          Eligible patients were aged 18 years or older, and had
          histologically or cytologically confirmed stage IV non-squamous
          non-small-cell lung cancer, an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group
          performance status of 0 or 1, and received no previous chemotherapy
          for stage IV disease. Patients were randomly assigned (2:1; permuted
          block [block size of six] with an interactive voice or web response
          system) to receive atezolizumab (1200 mg intravenously every 3
          weeks) plus chemotherapy (carboplatin [area under the curve 6 mg/mL
          per min every 3 weeks] plus nab-paclitaxel [100 mg/m2 intravenously
          every week]) or chemotherapy alone for four or six 21-day cycles
          followed by maintenance therapy. Stratification factors were sex,
          baseline liver metastases, and PD-L1 tumour expression. Co-primary
          endpoints were investigator-assessed progression-free survival and
          overall survival in the intention-to-treat wild-type (ie, EGFRwt and
          ALKwt) population. The safety population included patients who
          received at least one dose of the study drug. This study is
          registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02367781.
    AB  - FINDINGS: Between April 16, 2015, and Feb 13, 2017, 724
          patients were randomly assigned and 723 were included in the
          intention-to-treat population (one patient died before
          randomisation, but was assigned to a treatment group; this patient
          was excluded from the intention-to-treat population) of the
          atezolizumab plus chemotherapy group (483 patients in the
          intention-to-treat population and 451 patients in the
          intention-to-treat wild-type population) or the chemotherapy group
          (240 patients in the intention-to-treat population and 228 patients
          in the intention-to-treat wild-type population). Median follow-up in
          the intention-to-treat wild-type population was similar between
          groups (18.5 months [IQR 15.2-23.6] in the atezolizumab plus
          chemotherapy group and 19.2 months [15.4-23.0] in the chemotherapy
          group). In the intention-to-treat wild-type population, there were
          significant improvements in median overall survival (18.6 months
          [95% CI 16.0-21.2] in the atezolizumab plus chemotherapy group and
          13.9 months [12.0-18.7] in the chemotherapy group; stratified hazard
          ratio [HR] 0.79 [95% CI 0.64-0.98]; p=0.033) and median
          progression-free survival (7.0 months [95% CI 6.2-7.3] in the
          atezolizumab plus chemotherapy group and 5.5 months [4.4-5.9] in the
          chemotherapy group; stratified HR 0.64 [95% CI 0.54-0.77];
          p<0.0001]). The most common grade 3 or worse treatment-related
          adverse events were neutropenia (152 [32%] of 473 in the
          atezolizumab plus chemotherapy group vs 65 [28%] of 232 in the
          chemotherapy group), anaemia (138 [29%] vs 47 [20%]), and decreased
          neutrophil count (57 [12%] vs 19 [8%]). Treatment-related serious
          adverse events were reported in 112 (24%) of 473 patients in the
          atezolizumab plus chemotherapy group and 30 (13%) of 232 patients in
          the chemotherapy group. Treatment-related (any treatment) deaths
          occurred in eight (2%) of 473 patients in the atezolizumab plus
          chemotherapy group and one (<1%) of 232 patients in the chemotherapy
          group.
    AB  - INTERPRETATION: IMpower130 showed a significant and clinically
          meaningful improvement in overall survival and a significant
          improvement in progression-free survival with atezolizumab plus
          chemotherapy versus chemotherapy as first-line treatment of patients
          with stage IV non-squamous non-small-cell lung cancer and no ALK or
          EGFR mutations. No new safety signals were identified. This study
          supports the benefit of atezolizumab, in combination with
          platinum-based chemotherapy, as first-line treatment of metastatic
          non-small-cell lung cancer.

    AB  - BACKGROUND: Polatuzumab vedotin, an antibody-drug conjugate
          targeting the CD79b component of the B-cell receptor, has
          demonstrated activity as a single agent and in combination with
          rituximab in relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.
          In this study, we evaluated the safety and preliminary activity of
          polatuzumab vedotin in combination with rituximab or obinutuzumab
          and cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and prednisone (CHP) in patients
          with previously untreated diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.
    AB  - METHODS: This was an open-label, non-randomised study composed
          of a phase 1b dose escalation and a phase 2 dose expansion at 11
          hospitals and health centres in the USA and France. Patients aged 18
          years or older with B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma were eligible.
          Exclusion criteria included peripheral neuropathy with grade greater
          than 1, major surgery within 4 weeks before enrolment, known CNS
          involvement of lymphoma, and uncontrolled heart disease. Phase 1b
          dose escalation had a three-plus-three design and established the
          recommended phase 2 dose. Phase 2 expansion evaluated the
          recommended phase 2 dose of polatuzumab vedotin in patients with
          newly diagnosed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma with an International
          Prognostic Index (IPI) of 2-5. Patients received cyclophosphamide
          750 mg/m2 on day 1 intravenously, doxorubicin 50 mg/m2 on day 1
          intravenously, and prednisone 100 mg once daily on days 1-5 of each
          21-day cycle orally (CHP), plus either rituximab 375 mg/m2
          intravenously on day 1 of each cycle (R-CHP) or obinutuzumab 1000 mg
          intravenously on days 1, 8, and 15 of cycle 1 and on day 1 of the
          following cycles (G-CHP). Polatuzumab vedotin was administered on
          day 2 of cycles 1 and 2, and on day 1 of the following cycles at
          1.0-2.4 mg/kg during the escalation phase and at the recommended
          phase 2 dose during the expansion phase. Treatment could last six or
          eight cycles, depending on investigator preference. The primary
          endpoints of the study were safety and tolerability, and
          determination of the maximum tolerated dose (or recommended phase 2
          dose) of polatuzumab vedotin. All endpoints were analysed per
          protocol in the safety evaluable population, defined as all patients
          who received at least one dose of study treatment. This trial is
          registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01992653.
    AB  - FINDINGS: Between Dec 4, 2013, and July 26, 2016, 85 patients
          were enrolled. 82 patients were included in the safety and activity
          evaluable populations, 25 in phase 1b and 57 in phase 2. In light of
          information from other studies using polatuzumab vedotin reported
          during this study, in which the safety profile associated with
          exposure to polatuzumab vedotin at doses higher than 1.8 mg/kg every
          3 weeks was not outweighed by any clinical benefit, the recommended
          phase 2 dose was set to 1.8 mg/kg in the R-CHP cohort and no higher
          doses were explored in this study. 66 patients with newly diagnosed
          diffuse large B-cell lymphoma received the polatuzumab vedotin
          recommended phase 2 dose (45 R-CHP; 21 G-CHP). In 66 patients with
          diffuse large B-cell lymphoma who received the recommended phase 2
          dose, the most common adverse events of grade 3 or worse were
          neutropenia (20 [30%]), febrile neutropenia (12 [18%]), and
          thrombocytopenia (six [9%]). Among the 70 patients (any histology)
          who received the recommended phase 2 dose, 19 (27%) had grade 1
          peripheral neuropathy, eight (11%) grade 2, and two (3%) grade 3.
          Four deaths were reported during follow-up: two treatment-related
          (one complication of atrial fibrillation and one septic shock) and
          two due to disease progression. As of the cutoff date of Dec 29,
          2017, median follow-up time was 21.5 months (IQR 16.7-24.3) for the
          untreated diffuse large B-cell lymphoma cohort treated at the
          polatuzumab vedotin recommended phase 2 dose. 59 (89%) patients
          achieved an overall response at end of treatment (51 [77%] patients
          had a complete response, and eight [12%] patients had a partial
          response).
    AB  - INTERPRETATION: The safety of incorporating polatuzumab
          vedotin to R-CHP or G-CHP was as expected and managable. Preliminary
          clinical activity in newly diagnosed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma
          seems promising and encouraged a phase 3 trial comparing polatuzumab
          vedotin with R-CHP to R-CHOP.

    AB  - BACKGROUND: There is an unmet need for effective therapies for
          patients with advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer who cannot
          tolerate cisplatin-based chemotherapy. Cisplatin-ineligible patients
          experience a high frequency of adverse events from the most commonly
          used standard of care treatment, carboplatin plus gemcitabine, or
          alternative treatment with gemcitabine monotherapy. Pembrolizumab is
          a potent, highly selective humanised monoclonal antibody that
          releases checkpoint inhibition of the immune response system, and
          provides a new alternative for these patients.
    AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost-effectiveness of pembrolizumab
          for first-line treatment of urothelial carcinoma ineligible for
          cisplatin-based therapy in patients with strongly PD-L1-positive
          tumours in Sweden.
    AB  - DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Parametric survival curves
          were fitted to overall survival, progression-free survival, and time
          on treatment data from KEYNOTE-052 to extrapolate clinical outcomes.
          A simulated treatment comparison and a network meta-analysis were
          conducted to estimate the comparative efficacy of pembrolizumab
          versus carboplatin plus gemcitabine and gemcitabine monotherapy.
          EQ-5D data from KEYNOTE-052 were used to estimate utility, while
          resource use and cost inputs were estimated using Swedish regional
          pricing lists and clinician opinion.
    AB  - OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: The model
          reported costs, life years, and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs),
          and results were tested using deterministic and probabilistic
          sensitivity analysis.
    AB  - RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: We estimated that pembrolizumab would
          improve survival by 2.11 and 2.16 years and increase QALYs by 1.71
          and 1.75 compared to carboplatin plus gemcitabine and gemcitabine
          monotherapy, respectively. Pembrolizumab was associated with a cost
          increase of 90520 versus carboplatin plus gemcitabine and 95055
          versus gemcitabine, with corresponding incremental
          cost-effectiveness ratios of 53055/QALY and 54415/QALY.
    AB  - CONCLUSIONS: At a willingness-to-pay threshold of 100000/QALY,
          pembrolizumab is a cost-effective treatment versus carboplatin plus
          gemcitabine and versus gemcitabine.
    AB  - PATIENT SUMMARY: This is the first analysis to show that
          pembrolizumab is a cost-effective option for first-line treatment of
          cisplatin-ineligible patients with locally advanced or metastatic
          urothelial carcinoma in Sweden. Copyright &#xa9; 2018 Merck Sharp &

    AB  - BACKGROUND: IPH4102 is a first-in-class monoclonal antibody
          targeting KIR3DL2, a cell surface protein that is expressed in
          cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, and predominantly in its leukaemic form,
          Sezary syndrome. We aimed to assess the safety and activity of
          IPH4102 in cutaneous T-cell lymphoma.
    AB  - METHODS: We did an international, first-in-human, open-label,
          phase 1 clinical trial with dose-escalation and cohort-expansion
          parts in five academic hospitals in the USA, France, the UK, and the
          Netherlands. Eligible patients had histologically confirmed relapsed
          or refractory primary cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, an Eastern
          Cooperative Oncology group performance score of 2 or less, were aged
          18 years or older, and had received at least two previous systemic
          therapies. Ten dose levels of IPH4102, administered as an
          intravenous infusion, ranging from 0.0001 mg/kg to 10 mg/kg, were
          assessed using an accelerated 3 + 3 design. The primary endpoint was
          the occurrence of dose-limiting toxicities during the first 2 weeks
          of treatment, defined as toxicity grade 3 or worse lasting for 8 or
          more days, except for lymphopenia. Global overall response by
          cutaneous T-cell lymphoma subtype was a secondary endpoint. Safety
          and activity analyses were done in the per-protocol population. The
          study is ongoing and recruitment is complete. This trial is
          registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02593045.
    AB  - FINDINGS: Between Nov 4, 2015, and Nov 20, 2017, 44 patients
          were enrolled. 35 (80%) patients had Sezary syndrome, eight (18%)
          had mycosis fungoides, and one (2%) had primary cutaneous T-cell
          lymphoma, not otherwise specified. In the dose-escalation part, no
          dose limiting toxicity was reported and the trial's safety committee
          recommended a flat dose of 750 mg for the cohort-expansion,
          corresponding to the maximum administered dose. The most common
          adverse events were peripheral oedema (12 [27%] of 44 patients) and
          fatigue (nine [20%]), all of which were grade 1-2. Lymphopenia was
          the most common grade 3 or worse adverse event (three [7%]). One
          patient developed possibly treatment-related fulminant hepatitis 6
          weeks after IPH4102 discontinuation and subsequently died. However,
          the patient had evidence of human herpes virus-6B infection. Median
          follow-up was 14.1 months (IQR 11.3-20.5). A confirmed global
          overall response was achieved in 16 (36.4% [95% CI 23.8-51.1]) of 44
          patients, and of those, 15 responses were observed in 35 patients
          with Sezary syndrome (43% [28.0-59.1]).
    AB  - INTERPRETATION: IPH4102 is safe and shows encouraging clinical
          activity in patients with relapsed or refractory cutaneous T-cell
          lymphoma, particularly those with Sezary syndrome. If confirmed in
          future trials, IPH4102 could become a novel treatment option for
          these patients. A multi-cohort, phase 2 trial (TELLOMAK) is underway
          to confirm the activity in patients with Sezary syndrome and explore
          the role of IPH4102 in other subtypes of T-cell lymphomas that
          express KIR3DL2.

    AB  - BACKGROUND: Immunotherapy combination treatments can improve
          patient outcomes. Epacadostat, an IDO1 selective inhibitor, and
          pembrolizumab, a PD-1 inhibitor, showed promising antitumour
          activity in the phase 1-2 ECHO-202/KEYNOTE-037 study in advanced
          melanoma. In this trial, we aimed to compare progression-free
          survival and overall survival in patients with unresectable stage
          III or IV melanoma receiving epacadostat plus pembrolizumab versus
          placebo plus pembrolizumab.
    AB  - METHODS: In this international, randomised,
          placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel-group, phase 3 trial,
          eligible participants were aged 18 years or older, with unresectable
          stage III or IV melanoma previously untreated with PD-1 or PD-L1
          checkpoint inhibitors, an ECOG performance status of 0 or 1, and had
          a known BRAFV600 mutant status or consented to BRAFV600 mutation
          testing during screening. Patients were stratified by PD-L1
          expression and BRAFV600 mutation status and randomly assigned (1:1)
          through a central interactive voice and integrated web response
          system to receive epacadostat 100 mg orally twice daily plus
          pembrolizumab 200 mg intravenously every 3 weeks or placebo plus
          pembrolizumab for up to 2 years. We used block randomisation with a
          block size of four in each stratum. Primary endpoints were
          progression-free survival and overall survival in the
          intention-to-treat population. The safety analysis population
          included randomly assigned patients who received at least one dose
          of study treatment. The study was stopped after the second interim
          analysis; follow-up for safety is ongoing. This study is registered
          with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02752074.
    AB  - FINDINGS: Between June 21, 2016, and Aug 7, 2017, 928 patients
          were screened and 706 patients were randomly assigned to receive
          epacadostat plus pembrolizumab (n=354) or placebo plus pembrolizumab
          (n=352). Median follow-up was 12.4 months (IQR 10.3-14.5). No
          significant differences were found between the treatment groups for
          progression-free survival (median 4.7 months, 95% CI 2.9-6.8, for
          epacadostat plus pembrolizumab vs 4.9 months, 2.9-6.8, for placebo
          plus pembrolizumab; hazard ratio [HR] 1.00, 95% CI 0.83-1.21;
          one-sided p=0.52) or overall survival (median not reached in either
          group; epacadostat plus pembrolizumab vs placebo plus pembrolizumab:
          HR 1.13, 0.86-1.49; one-sided p=0.81). The most common grade 3 or
          worse treatment-related adverse event was lipase increase, which
          occurred in 14 (4%) of 353 patients receiving epacadostat plus
          pembrolizumab and 11 (3%) of 352 patients receiving placebo plus
          pembrolizumab. Treatment-related serious adverse events were
          reported in 37 (10%) of 353 patients receiving epacadostat plus
          pembrolizumab and 32 (9%) of 352 patients receiving placebo plus
          pembrolizumab. There were no treatment-related deaths in either
          treatment group.
    AB  - INTERPRETATION: Epacadostat 100 mg twice daily plus
          pembrolizumab did not improve progression-free survival or overall
          survival compared with placebo plus pembrolizumab in patients with
          unresectable or metastatic melanoma. The usefulness of IDO1
          inhibition as a strategy to enhance anti-PD-1 therapy activity in
          cancer remains uncertain.

    AB  - PURPOSE: Preclinical studies suggest PARP inhibition (PARPi)
          induces immunostimulatory micromilieu in ovarian cancer thus
          complementing activity of immune checkpoint blockade. We conducted a
          phase II trial of PARPi olaparib and anti-PD-L1 durvalumab and
          collected paired fresh core biopsies and blood samples to test this
          hypothesis.
    AB  - PATIENTS AND METHODS: In a single-center, proof-of-concept
          phase II study, we enrolled women aged >=18 with recurrent ovarian
          cancer. All patients were immune checkpoint inhibitor-naive and had
          measurable disease per RECISTv1.1, ECOG performance status 0-2, and
          adequate organ and marrow function. Patients received olaparib 300
          mg twice daily and durvalumab 1,500 mg intravenously every 4 weeks
          until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or withdrawal of
          consent. Primary endpoint was overall response rate (ORR). Secondary
          objectives were safety and progression-free survival (PFS).
          Translational objectives included biomarker evaluation for
          relationships with clinical response and immunomodulatory effects by
          treatment.
    AB  - RESULTS: Thirty-five patients with ovarian cancer [median,
          four prior therapies (IQR, 2-5.5), predominantly platinum-resistant
          (86%), BRCA wild-type (77%)] received at least one full cycle of
          treatment. ORR was 14% [5/35; 95% confidence interval (CI),
          4.8%-30.3%]. Disease control rate (PR+SD) was 71% (25/35; 95% CI,
          53.7%-85.4%). Treatment enhanced IFNgamma and CXCL9/CXCL10
          expression, systemic IFNgamma/TNFalpha production, and
          tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, indicating an immunostimulatory
          environment. Increased IFNgamma production was associated with
          improved PFS [HR, 0.37 (95% CI, 0.16-0.87), P = 0.023], while
          elevated VEGFR3 levels were associated with worse PFS (HR, 3.22 (95%
          CI, 1.23-8.40), P = 0.017].
    AB  - CONCLUSIONS: The PARPi and anti-PD-L1 combination showed
          modest clinical activity in recurrent ovarian cancer. Our
          correlative study results suggest immunomodulatory effects by
          olaparib/durvalumab in patients and indicate that VEGF/VEGFR pathway
          blockade would be necessary for improved efficacy of the
          combination. Copyright &#xa9;2020 American Association for Cancer

    AB  - BACKGROUND: Improvement in clinical outcomes of patients with
          platinum-resistant disease is an unmet medical need and trials in
          this population are urgently needed. Checkpoint-inhibitors have
          already shown activity in multiple other tumor entities and ovarian
          cancer, especially in the combination with anti-angiogenic
          treatment.
    AB  - PRIMARY OBJECTIVE: To test if the activity of
          non-platinum-based chemotherapy and bevacizumab could be improved by
          the addition of atezolizumab.
    AB  - STUDY HYPOTHESIS: The addition of atezolizumab to standard
          non-platinum combination of chemotherapy and bevacizumab improves
          median overall survival from 15 to 20 months.
    AB  - TRIAL DESIGN: Patients are randomized to chemotherapy
          (paclitaxel weekly or pegylated liposomal doxorubicin) + bevacizumab
          + placebo vs chemotherapy + bevacizumab + atezolizumab.
          Stratification factors are: number of prior lines, planned type of
          chemotherapy, prior use of bevacizumab, and tumor programmed
          death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) status.
    AB  - MAJOR INCLUSION/EXCLUSION CRITERIA: Recurrent epithelial
          ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer with up to
          three prior therapies and a treatment-free interval after platinum
          of less than 6 months. Patients with three prior lines of
          chemotherapy are eligible irrespective of the platinum
          free-interval. A de novo tumor tissue sample biopsy for
          determination of PD-L1 status prior to randomization for
          stratification is mandatory. Major exclusion criteria consider
          bevacizumab-specific and immunotherapy-specific criteria.
    AB  - PRIMARY ENDPOINT: Overall survival and progression-free
          survival are co-primary endpoints.
    AB  - SAMPLE SIZE: It is planned to randomize 664 patients.

    AB  - Background: The effectiveness of immunotherapies for
          non-small-cell lung cancer under real-world clinical settings
          remains uncertain. Materials & methods: Systematic searches of
          PubMed, EMBASE and Web of Science were conducted. Random-effects
          models were used to estimate pooled median overall survival and
          progression-free survival estimates. Results: 36 studies of
          nivolumab were included for narrative synthesis and 11 of these
          studies were included for meta-analysis. Age, sex, histology and
          prior lines of treatment did not affect survival outcomes, while
          Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status and brain
          metastasis were inversely associated with survival. In the
          meta-analysis, nivolumab was associated with 9.6 months (95% CI:
          8.4-10.9) of overall survival and 2.6 months (95% CI: 1.6-3.6) of
          progression-free survival. Conclusion:  Very-low-certainty evidence
          suggested the real-world effectiveness of nivolumab was consistent
          with those observed in the clinical trials.

    AB  - Immune checkpoint inhibitors are affirming as standard care
          for advanced lung cancer treatment. Despite their proved efficacy,
          alone or in combination, they are capable to provoke several
          cutaneous immune-mediated adverse events. This systematic review
          aimed to determine the prevalence of cutaneous toxicity in patients
          with lung cancer undergoing immune checkpoint inhibitors alone,
          combined, or associated with chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy. The
          searches were performed in CINAHL, Cochrane CENTRAL, LILACS, LILIVO,
          PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science. We included both clinical trials
          and observational studies that described cutaneous toxicities
          presented by patients during treatment with immunological checkpoint
          inhibitors. The final sample consisted of 24 studies in which 9127
          patients were evaluated. In included studies, the drug under
          consideration were ipilimumab, pembrolizumab nivolumab, and
          atezolizumab, at different dosages. The most prevalent
          dermatological toxicities were alopecia (27%), pruritus, and rash
          (10%). Remarkably, the prevalent severity was graded 1-2 for both
          alopecia, pruritus and rash. Copyright &#xa9; 2020 Elsevier B.V. All

    AB  - Immunotherapy-based options for patients with advanced
          non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) are increasing at an
          unprecedented pace, carrying the promise to prolong survival of this
          deadly disease. To maximize responses and extend benefit to a larger
          portion of patients, immunotherapy combination strategies are
          currently under investigation, with chemo-immunotherapy already in
          use. Combinations of programmed death-1/ligand-1 (PD-1/L1) and
          cytotoxic T lymphocytes antigen-4 (CTLA-4) were developed with the
          rationale of targeting complementary pathways involved in T cell
          activation, and already showed to be highly active in other
          malignancies. Recently, the phase III Checkmate 227 trial showed
          that combination of nivolumab and ipilimumab provided survival
          benefit in untreated advanced NSCLC patients. However, accurate
          patients' selection and appropriate sequencing of different
          immunotherapy-based approaches remain unsolved. In this review, we
          provide an overview of the currently available evidence on double
          immune checkpoint inhibition (ICI) for NSCLC treatment and discuss
          current issues and future perspectives. Copyright &#xa9; 2020

    AB  - PURPOSE: This phase 2 study tested granulocyte-macrophage
          colony-stimulating factor-secreting allogeneic pancreatic tumor
          cells (GVAX) and ipilimumab in metastatic pancreatic ductal
          adenocarcinoma (PDA) in the maintenance setting.
    AB  - METHODS: Patients with PDA who were treated with front-line
          chemotherapy consisting of 5-fluorouracil, leucovorin, irinotecan,
          and oxaliplatin (FOLFIRINOX) in the metastatic setting and had
          ongoing response or stable disease after 8-12 doses were eligible.
          Patients were randomized 1:1 to treatment with GVAX and ipilimumab
          given every 3 weeks for 4 doses then every 8 weeks (Arm A) or to
          FOLFIRINOX continuation (Arm B). The primary objective was to
          compare overall survival (OS) between the two arms.
    AB  - RESULTS: Eighty-two patients were included in the final
          analysis (Arm A: 40; Arm B: 42). The study was stopped for futility
          after interim analysis. Median overall survival (OS) was 9.38 months
          (95% CI: 5.0, 12.2) for Arm A and 14.7 months (95% CI: 11.6, 20.0)
          for Arm B (HR 1.75, p=0.019). Using immune related-response
          criteria, 2 partial responses (5.7%) were observed in Arm A and 4
          (13.8%) in Arm B. GVAX + ipilimumab promoted T cell differentiation
          into effector memory phenotypes both in the periphery and in the
          tumor microenvironment and increased M1 macrophages in the tumor.
    AB  - CONCLUSIONS: GVAX and ipilimumab maintenance therapy did not
          improve OS over continuation of chemotherapy and resulted in a
          numerically inferior survival in metastatic PDA. However, clinical
          responses and biological effects on immune cells were observed.
          Further study of novel combinations in the maintenance treatment of
          metastatic PDA is feasible. Copyright &#xa9;2020, American

    AB  - BACKGROUND: The optimal treatment of recurrent ovarian clear
          cell carcinoma remains unknown. There is increasing rationale to
          support the role of immune checkpoint inhibitors targeting the
          programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1)/programmed death-ligand 1
          (PD-L1) axis in ovarian clear cell carcinoma.
    AB  - PRIMARY OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of durvalumab
          (MEDI-4736) compared with standard chemotherapy in patients with
          recurrent ovarian clear cell carcinoma.
    AB  - STUDY HYPOTHESIS: Patients with recurrent ovarian clear cell
          carcinoma treated with durvalumab will have improved
          progression-free survival compared with those treated with
          chemotherapy of physician's choice.
    AB  - TRIAL DESIGN: The MOCCA study is a multicenter, open-label,
          randomized phase II trial in patients with recurrent ovarian clear
          cell carcinoma, which recruited from eight sites across Gynecologic
          Cancer Group Singapore (GCGS), Korean Gynecologic-Oncology Group
          (KGOG), and Australia New Zealand Gynecological Oncology Group
          (ANZGOG). Enrolled patients were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to
          receive durvalumab or physician's choice of chemotherapy until
          disease progression, intolerable toxicity, or withdrawal of patient
          consent.
    AB  - MAJOR INCLUSION/EXCLUSION CRITERIA: Eligible patients required
          histologically documented diagnosis of recurrent ovarian clear cell
          carcinoma, as evidenced by WT1 negativity. All patients must have
          been of Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status
          2 or better, and have had previous treatment with, and progressed or
          recurred after prior platinum-based chemotherapy. No more than four
          prior lines of treatment were allowed and prior immune checkpoint
          inhibitor treatment was not permitted.
    AB  - PRIMARY ENDPOINTS: The primary endpoint was the median
          progression-free survival following treatment with durvalumab,
          compared with physician's choice of chemotherapy. Progression-free
          survival was defined as the time from the first day of treatment to
          the first observation of disease progression, or death due to any
          cause, or last follow-up.
    AB  - SAMPLE SIZE: The target sample size was 46 patients.
    AB  - ESTIMATED DATES FOR COMPLETING ACCRUAL AND PRESENTING RESULTS:
          Accrual has been completed and results are expected to be presented
          by mid-2021.

    AB  - BACKGROUND: Pembrolizumab, an anti-PD-1 antibody, results in
          tumour response in around 15% of patients with advanced gastric
          cancer who have a PD-L1 combined positive score of at least 1.
          Lenvatinib, a multikinase inhibitor of VEGF receptors and other
          receptor tyrosine kinases, substantially decreased tumour-associated
          macrophages and increased infiltration of CD8 T cells, resulting in
          enhanced anti-tumour activity of PD-1 inhibitors in an in-vivo
          model. We aimed to assess the combination of lenvatinib plus
          pembrolizumab in patients with advanced gastric cancer in a phase 2
          study.
    AB  - METHODS: This study was an open-label, single-arm, phase 2
          trial undertaken at the National Cancer Center Hospital East (Chiba,
          Japan). Eligible patients were aged 20 years or older and had
          metastatic or recurrent adenocarcinoma of the stomach or
          gastro-oesophageal junction, an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group
          performance status of 0 or 1, and measurable disease according to
          the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST version
          1.1), irrespective of the number of previous lines of treatment.
          Patients received 20 mg oral lenvatinib daily plus 200 mg
          intravenous pembrolizumab every 3 weeks until disease progression,
          development of intolerable toxicity, or withdrawal of consent. The
          primary endpoint was objective response rate according to RECIST,
          analysed in all patients who were eligible and received protocol
          treatment at least once. The safety analysis included all those who
          received protocol treatment at least once, regardless of
          eligibility. This study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov,
          NCT03609359, and enrolment is complete.
    AB  - FINDINGS: Between Oct 15, 2018, and March 25, 2019, 29
          patients were enrolled in the first-line or second-line settings. At
          data cutoff (March 20, 2020), the median follow-up was 12.6 months
          (IQR 10.5-14.3). 20 (69%, 95% CI 49-85) of 29 patients had an
          objective response. The most common grade 3 treatment-related
          adverse events were hypertension (in 11 [38%] patients), proteinuria
          (five [17%]), and platelet count decrease (two [7%]). No grade 4
          treatment-related adverse events, serious treatment-related adverse
          events, or treatment-related deaths occurred.
    AB  - INTERPRETATION: Lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab showed promising
          anti-tumour activity with an acceptable safety profile in patients
          with advanced gastric cancer. On the basis of these results, a
          confirmatory trial will be planned in the future.

    AB  - PURPOSE: Although cisplatin plus radiotherapy is a standard
          treatment of locally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma
          (LA-HNSCC), cisplatin contraindication is common. Radiation elicits
          and promotes tumor-directed immune stimulation, which may potentiate
          anti-PD-1 therapy. We provide the first efficacy report of combined
          pembrolizumab and definitive radiotherapy in LA-HNSCC.
    AB  - PATIENTS AND METHODS: This single-arm, multi-institution,
          phase II study (NCT02609503) enrolled 29 cisplatin-ineligible
          patients. Patients received radiotherapy concurrently with three
          cycles of pembrolizumab 200 mg every 3 weeks followed by three
          adjuvant cycles. The primary endpoint was a progression-free
          survival (PFS) of >=16 months. Correlative studies included
          peripheral blood flow cytometry and Luminex cytokine profiling.
    AB  - RESULTS: Reasons for cisplatin ineligibility included otopathy
          (69.0%), nephropathy (20.7%), and neuropathy (6.9%). With median
          follow-up of 21 months, estimated 24-month PFS and overall survival
          rates were 71% (95% confidence interval, 49%-84%) and 75% (51%-88%).
          The primary PFS endpoint has exceeded the hypothesis and its median
          has not been reached. Toxicities were typical of radiotherapy;
          however, high rates of grade 3/4 lymphopenia (58.6%) were observed.
          Flow cytometry revealed a relative decline in CD4 T cells and B
          cells, but not CD8 T cells. Upon treatment, frequencies of
          transitional B cells and tissue-like memory B cells increased, while
          resting memory B cells decreased. Patients with progression had
          greater percentages of baseline naive B cells and fewer marginal
          zone B cells.
    AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Pembrolizumab and radiotherapy is efficacious in
          LA-HNSCC and should be evaluated in a randomized trial. The observed
          changes in B-cell markers deserve further study both as potential
          biomarkers and as therapeutic targets. Copyright &#xa9;2020 American

    AB  - For decades, the treatment of advanced prostate cancer was
          mainly based on the manipulation of the androgen receptor-controlled
          proliferation pathway. Chemotherapy only played an additional
          important role with the advent of taxanes. The progress in
          translational research in recent years has led to innovations in the
          therapeutic environment. With the decoding of the homologous repair
          deficiency (HRD) machinery and its ability to be influenced by PARP
          inhibitors, targeted therapies moved into the therapeutic focus for
          selected patients. The first positive phase III study for PARP
          inhibitors is already available. In addition, immunotherapy for the
          treatment of prostate cancer, which is now widely used in oncology,
          is also making progress; both checkpoint inhibitors and bispecific
          antibodies have shown clinically useful activities. Cellular
          therapies such as CAR T cells, which are directed against
          prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA), are still at an early
          stage of development. In this review, the authors provide a summary
          of the basic principles and clinical development of these new
          therapies.

    AB  - BACKGROUND: Durvalumab has shown meaningful clinical activity
          in patients with metastatic urothelial carcinoma (mUC) in Study 1108
          (NCT01693562). An important focus in treatment is health-related
          quality of life (HRQOL). Here, patient-reported outcomes (PROs) from
          Study 1108 and their relationship with inflammatory biomarkers are
          explored.
    AB  - METHODS: Disease-related symptoms, functioning, and HRQOL were
          assessed with the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Bladder
          (FACT-Bl) and the European Organisation for Research and Treatment
          of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30 (QLQ-C30).
          Relationships between PRO improvements and the best changes in the
          tumor size, albumin level, and neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR)
          were assessed with Spearman correlation analysis.
    AB  - RESULTS: The mean FACT-Bl total score improved from 107.5
          (standard deviation [SD], 23.0) at the baseline to 115.4 (SD, 22.6)
          on day 113, with similar increases found for the Trial Outcome Index
          (TOI) and Bladder Cancer Subscale (BLCS) scores. The mean FACT-Bl
          total scores improved over time, and the FACT-Bl TOI scores
          significantly improved by day 113 (P < .05). The mean EORTC QLQ-C30
          Global Health Status/Quality of Life score improved from 57.1 (SD,
          24.8) at the baseline to 69.0 (SD, 21.4) on day 113; the functional
          scale and symptom scores (day 113) were higher than the baseline
          scores (P < .05) for EORTC Social Functioning. The FACT-Bl total,
          BLCS, and TOI scores improved in 32.6%, 34.9%, and 32.6% of the
          patients by day 113; 26.3% to 37.8% of the patients exhibited
          improvements in EORTC QLQ-C30 functional scores. The best tumor
          shrinkage and posttreatment improvements in serum albumin and NLR
          correlated with increases in FACT-Bl total, TOI, and BLCS scores and
          in EORTC Physical Functioning and Role Functioning scores (P < .05).
    AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Durvalumab was associated with improvements in
          disease-related symptoms, functioning, and HRQOL in patients with
          mUC. Improvements in systemic inflammation may contribute to PRO
          improvements in these patients. Copyright &#xa9; 2019 American

    AB  - BACKGROUND: Nivolumab has shown a survival benefit compared
          with docetaxel as second-line treatment for patients with previously
          treated advanced squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in a
          randomized phase III trial. The experiences of patients and
          physicians in routine clinical practice are often different from
          those in a controlled clinical trial setting. We present data from
          the entire Italian cohort of patients with squamous NSCLC enrolled
          in a worldwide nivolumab NSCLC expanded access program.
    AB  - PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with pretreated advanced
          squamous NSCLC received nivolumab 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks for up to 24
          months. Safety was monitored throughout; efficacy data collected
          included objective tumor response, date of progression, and survival
          information.
    AB  - RESULTS: The Italian cohort comprised 371 patients who
          received at least one dose of nivolumab. In the overall population,
          the objective response rate (ORR) was 18%, the disease control rate
          (DCR) was 47%, and median overall survival (OS) was 7.9 months (95%
          confidence interval 6.2-9.6). In subgroup analyses, ORR, DCR, and
          median OS were, respectively, 17%, 48%, and 9.1 months in patients
          previously treated with two or more lines of therapy (n = 209) and
          8%, 40%, and 10.0 months in patients treated beyond disease
          progression (n = 65). In the overall population, the rate of
          any-grade and grade 3-4 adverse events was 29% and 6%, respectively.
          Treatment-related adverse events led to treatment discontinuation in
          14 patients (5%). There were no treatment-related deaths.
    AB  - CONCLUSION: To date, this report represents the most extensive
          clinical experience with nivolumab in advanced squamous NSCLC in
          current practice outside the controlled clinical trial setting.
          These data suggest that the efficacy and safety profiles of
          nivolumab in a broad, real-world setting are consistent with those
          obtained in clinical trials.
    AB  - IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Nivolumab is approved in the U.S.
          and Europe for the treatment of advanced non-small cell lung cancer
          (NSCLC) after failure of prior platinum-based chemotherapy. In this
          cohort of Italian patients with previously treated, advanced
          squamous NSCLC treated in a real-world setting as part of the
          nivolumab expanded access program, the efficacy and safety of
          nivolumab was consistent with that previously reported in nivolumab
          clinical trials. Copyright &#xa9; AlphaMed Press 2019.

    AB  - OBJECTIVES: Many patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the
          head and neck (SCCHN) are >=65years old; comorbidities and other
          age-related factors may affect their ability to tolerate traditional
          chemotherapy. Nivolumab is the only immunotherapy to significantly
          improve overall survival (OS) versus investigator's choice (IC) of
          single-agent chemotherapy at primary analysis in a phase 3 trial
          (CheckMate 141) in patients with recurrent/metastatic SCCHN
          post-platinum therapy. In this post hoc analysis, we report efficacy
          and safety by age.
    AB  - PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eligible patients were randomized 2:1 to
          nivolumab 3mg/kg every 2weeks (n=240) or IC (methotrexate,
          docetaxel, or cetuximab n=121). The primary endpoint of the trial
          was OS. For this analysis, outcomes were analyzed by age<65 and
          >=65years. The data cut-off date was September 2017 (minimum
          follow-up 24.2months).
    AB  - RESULTS: At baseline, 68 patients (28.3%) receiving nivolumab
          and 45 patients (37.2%) receiving IC were >=65years. Baseline
          characteristics were generally similar across age groups. OS and
          tumor response benefits with nivolumab versus IC were maintained
          regardless of age. The 30-month OS rates of 11.2% (<65years) and
          13.0% (>=65years) with nivolumab were more than tripled versus
          corresponding IC rates of 1.4% and 3.3%, respectively. The nivolumab
          arm had a lower rate of treatment-related adverse events versus IC
          regardless of age, consistent with the overall patient population.
    AB  - CONCLUSION: In CheckMate 141, nivolumab resulted in a higher
          survival versus IC in patients <65 and >=65years, with a manageable
          safety profile in both age groups. ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02105636.

    AB  - BACKGROUND: This meta-analysis systematically evaluated the
          efficacy of PD-1 and PD-L1 inhibitors for the treatment of advanced
          non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and investigated the efficacy of
          first-line therapy and PD-1 versus PD-L1 inhibitors.
    AB  - METHODS: PubMed, The Cochrane Library, and Embase were
          searched up to November 2018 for randomized controlled trials (RCTs)
          for eligible studies. The outcome of interest was overall survival
          (OS). The methodology was based on the Preferred Reporting Items for
          Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses and Cochrane Collaboration
          guidelines. Data were pooled by using the random effects model and
          expressed as hazard ratios (HRs) and corresponding 95% confidence
          intervals (CIs). Heterogeneity was assessed and quantified (I 2 ).
    AB  - RESULTS: Seven RCTs were included in this study. PD-1/PD-L1
          inhibitors achieved superior OS compared to chemotherapy (HR 0.72,
          95% CI 0.63-0.82; P < 0.0001). OS was superior in previously treated
          patients compared to untreated patients (HR 0.69, 95% CI 0.63-0.76;
          HR 0.82, 95% CI 0.47-1.44, respectively). No significant differences
          in OS were observed between PD-1 and PD-L1 inhibitors (HR 0.71, 95%
          CI 0.59-0.86; HR 0.73, 95% CI 0.63-0.84, respectively).
    AB  - CONCLUSIONS: PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors significantly prolonged the
          OS of previously treated patients. No significant differences in OS
          were observed between PD-1 and PD-L1 inhibitors. Copyright &#xa9;

    AB  - BACKGROUND: Immune-related pneumonitis is a clinically
          relevant and potentially life-threatening adverse event. We
          performed a systematic review and network meta-analysis to compare
          the risk of immune-related pneumonitis among different PD1/PD-L1
          inhibitor-related therapeutic regimens.
    AB  - METHODS: Randomized controlled trials with PD1/PD-L1
          inhibitors were identified through comprehensive searches of
          multiple databases. Both published and unpublished data were
          extracted. Bayesian NMA was performed using random-effects models.
          All-grade (Grade 1-5) and high-grade (Grade 3-5) immune-related
          pneumonitis were estimated using odds ratios (ORs).
    AB  - RESULTS: A total of 25 studies involving 16 005 patients were
          included. Compared with chemotherapy, the ORs of immune-related
          all-grade and high-grade pneumonitis were significant for nivolumab
          (all-grade: OR = 6.29, 95% CrI: 2.67-16.75; high-grade: OR = 5.95,
          95% CrI: 2.35-17.29), pembrolizumab (all-grade: OR = 5.78, 95% CrI:
          2.79-13.24; high-grade: OR = 5.33, 95% CrI: 2.49-12.97), and
          nivolumab plus ipilimumab therapy (all-grade: OR = 14.82, 95% CrI:
          5.48-47.97; high-grade: OR = 15.26, 95% CrI: 5.05-55.52). Compared
          with nivolumab, nivolumab plus ipilimumab therapy was associated
          with an increased risk of all-grade pneumonitis (OR = 2.34, 95% CrI:
          1.07-5.77). Nivolumab plus ipilimumab therapy had the highest risk
          of both all-grade and high-grade pneumonitis among PD1/PD-L1
          inhibitor-related therapeutic regimens.
    AB  - CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that compared with
          chemotherapy, PD-1 inhibitor may result in a higher risk of
          immune-related pneumonitis. Nivolumab plus ipilimumab therapy had
          the highest pneumonitis risk. These findings could be taken into
          account by the physicians in decision making. Copyright &#xa9; 2019

    AB  - INTRODUCTION: Osimertinib is a third-generation EGFR-tyrosine
          kinase inhibitor (TKI). Durvalumab is an anti-programmed death
          ligand 1 monoclonal antibody. The phase III open-label CAURAL trial
          (NCT02454933) investigated osimertinib plus durvalumab versus
          osimertinib monotherapy in patients with EGFR-TKI sensitizing and
          EGFR T790M mutation-positive advanced NSCLC and disease progression
          after EGFR-TKI therapy.
    AB  - METHODS: Patients were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive orally
          administered osimertinib (80 mg once daily) with or without
          durvalumab (10 mg/kg administered intravenously every 2 weeks) until
          progression. Treatment could continue beyond progression, providing
          clinical benefit continued (judged by the investigator). The amended
          primary objective was to assess the safety and tolerability of
          osimertinib plus durvalumab; efficacy was an exploratory objective.
    AB  - RESULTS: CAURAL recruitment was terminated early because of
          increased incidence of interstitial lung disease-like events in the
          osimertinib plus durvalumab arm from the separate phase Ib TATTON
          trial (NCT02143466). At termination of CAURAL recruitment, 15
          patients had been randomly assigned to treatment with osimertinib
          and 14 to treatment with osimertinib plus durvalumab. The most
          common AEs were diarrhea (53% [grade >=3 in 6% of patients]) in the
          osimertinib arm and rash (67% [grade >=3 in 0 patients]) in the
          combination arm. One patient who had been randomized to the
          combination arm reported grade 2 interstitial lung disease while
          receiving osimertinib monotherapy (after discontinuing durvalumab
          therapy after one dose). The objective response rates were 80% in
          the osimertinib arm and 64% in the combination arm.
    AB  - CONCLUSION: Limited patient numbers preclude formal safety and
          efficacy comparisons between the two treatment arms. The combination
          of programmed cell death 1/programmed death ligand 1 inhibitors and
          EGFR-TKIs as therapy for NSCLC is not well understood, but it
          requires a careful approach if considered in the future. Copyright

          (ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01905657), pembrolizumab significantly
          prolonged overall survival over docetaxel in patients with
          previously treated, programmed death ligand 1-expressing (tumor
          proportion score >= 1%), advanced NSCLC. Health-related quality of
          life (HRQoL) results are reported here.
    AB  - METHODS: Patients were randomized 1:1:1 to pembrolizumab 2 or
          10 mg/kg every 3 weeks or docetaxel 75 mg/m2 every 3 weeks. HRQoL
          was assessed using European Organisation for Research and Treatment
          of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaire (QLC) Core 30 (C30),
          EORTC QLQ-Lung Cancer 13 (LC13), and EuroQoL-5D. Key analyses
          included mean baseline-to-week-12 change in global health status
          (GHS)/quality of life (QoL) score, functioning and symptom domains,
          and time to deterioration in a QLQ-LC13 composite endpoint of cough,
          dyspnea, and chest pain.
    AB  - RESULTS: Patient reported outcomes compliance was high across
          all three instruments. Pembrolizumab was associated with better
          QLQ-C30 GHS/QoL scores from baseline to 12 weeks than docetaxel,
          regardless of pembrolizumab dose or tumor proportion score status
          (not significant). Compared with docetaxel, fewer
          pembrolizumab-treated patients had "deteriorated" status and more
          had "improved" status in GHS/QoL. Nominally significant improvement
          was reported in many EORTC symptom domains with pembrolizumab, and
          nominally significant worsening was reported with docetaxel.
          Significant prolongation in true time to deterioration for the
          QLQ-LC13 composite endpoint emerged for pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg
          compared to docetaxel (nominal two-sided p = 0.03), but not for the
          2-mg/kg dose.
    AB  - CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that HRQoL and symptoms
          are maintained or improved to a greater degree with pembrolizumab
          than with docetaxel in this NSCLC patient population. Copyright

    AB  - INTRODUCTION: This randomized phase II trial aimed at
          evaluating the engineered programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1)
          antibody atezolizumab in SCLC progressing after first-line
          platinum-etoposide chemotherapy.
    AB  - METHODS: Patients were randomized 2:1 to atezolizumab (1200 mg
          intravenously every 3 weeks) until progression or unacceptable
          toxicity, or conventional chemotherapy (up to 6 cycles of topotecan
          or re-induction of initial chemotherapy). Patients were not selected
          based on PD-L1 tissue expression. The primary endpoint was objective
          response rate at 6 weeks. A two-stage design with 2:1 randomization
          and O'Brien-Fleming stopping rules was used. The null hypothesis was
          rejected if more than 12 of 45 patients were responders.
    AB  - RESULTS: Overall, 73 patients were randomized (atezolizumab n
          = 49; chemotherapy n = 24). At 6 weeks, 1 of 43 eligible
          atezolizumab patients achieved an objective response (2.3%, 95%
          confidence interval [CI]: 0.0-6.8), whereas 8 others had stable
          disease (20.9% disease control rate; 95% CI: 8.8-33.1). Among
          eligible chemotherapy patients (n = 20), 10% achieved an objective
          response (65% disease control rate). Median progression-free
          survival was 1.4 months (95% CI: 1.2-1.5) with atezolizumab and 4.3
          months (95% CI: 1.5-5.9) with chemotherapy. Overall survival did not
          significantly differ between groups. Median overall survival was 9.5
          months versus 8.7 months for the atezolizumab and the chemotherapy
          group, respectively (adjusted hazard ratioatezolizumab : 0.84, 95%
          CI: 0.45-1.58; p = 0.60). Two atezolizumab patients (4.2%)
          experienced grade 3 fatigue, and two others grade 1 dysthyroidism.
          Among 53 evaluable specimens, only 1 (2%) had positive
          immunohistochemical PD-L1 staining (SP142 clone).
    AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Atezolizumab monotherapy in relapsed SCLC failed
          to show significant efficacy. No unexpected safety concerns were
          observed. Copyright &#xa9; 2019 International Association for the

    AB  - INTRODUCTION: Data on immuno-oncology agents in Chinese
          patients are limited despite a need for new therapies. We evaluated
          the efficacy and safety of nivolumab in a predominantly Chinese
          patient population with previously treated NSCLC.
    AB  - METHODS: CheckMate 078 was a randomized, open-label, phase III
          clinical trial in patients from China, Russia, and Singapore with
          squamous or nonsquamous NSCLC that had progressed during/after
          platinum-based doublet chemotherapy (ClinicalTrials.gov:
          NCT02613507). Patients with EGFR/ALK alterations were excluded.
          Patients (N = 504) were randomized 2:1 to nivolumab (3 mg/kg every 2
          weeks) or docetaxel (75 mg/m2 every 3 weeks), stratified by
          performance status, tumor histology, and tumor programmed death
          ligand 1 expression. The primary endpoint was overall survival (OS);
          secondary endpoints included objective response rate,
          progression-free survival, and safety.
    AB  - RESULTS: OS was significantly improved with nivolumab (n =
          338) versus docetaxel (n = 166); median OS (95% confidence
          interval): 12.0 (10.4-14.0) versus 9.6 (7.6-11.2) months,
          respectively; hazard ratio (97.7% confidence interval): 0.68
          (0.52-0.90); p = 0.0006. Objective response rate was 17% with
          nivolumab versus 4% with docetaxel; median duration of response was
          not reached versus 5.3 months. Minimum follow-up was 8.8 months. The
          frequency of grade 3 or greater treatment-related adverse events was
          10% with nivolumab and 48% with docetaxel.
    AB  - CONCLUSIONS: This is the first phase III study in a
          predominantly Chinese population reporting results with a programmed
          death 1 inhibitor. In this population with previously treated
          advanced NSCLC, nivolumab improved OS versus docetaxel. Results were
          consistent with global CheckMate 017 and 057 studies. Copyright

    AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of this meta-analysis was to compare
          patient-reported outcomes (PROs) between programmed death
          receptor-1/programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-1/PD-L1) inhibitors and
          standard-of-care therapy in patients with advanced cancer.
    AB  - METHODS: We searched randomized controlled trials (RCTs)
          comparing single-agent PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors (nivolumab,
          pembrolizumab, atezolizumab, avelumab, or durvalumab) with
          standard-of-care therapy in patients with advanced cancer reporting
          PROs with generic measures: the European Organisation for Research
          and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30 items
          (QLQ-C30) and the EuroQol Five Dimensions Questionnaire. The summary
          outcomes were changes in PROs from baseline to follow-up within and
          between treatment groups and time to deterioration (TTD) in PROs
          based on clinically meaningful change.
    AB  - RESULTS: A total of 6,334 patients from 13 RCTs were included:
          six nivolumab, five pembrolizumab, and two atezolizumab trials. For
          the QLQ-C30 global health status/quality of life, the pooled
          difference in mean change between treatment groups was 5.1 (95%
          confidence interval [CI], 3.3-6.9; p < .001) favoring PD-1/PD-L1
          inhibitors. The pooled mean change from baseline in PD-1/PD-L1
          inhibitors and controls was 0.1 (95% CI, -2.2, 2.5) and - 6.1 (95%
          CI, -8.4, -3.8), respectively. The TTD was significantly longer with
          PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors, with a hazard ratio of 0.72 (95% CI,
          0.55-0.93; p = .011). Similarly, significantly better outcomes were
          noted with PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors on most of the other PRO measures.
    AB  - CONCLUSION: PD1/PD-L1 inhibitors maintained health-related
          quality of life to a greater degree and had less worsening in
          symptoms than standard-of-care therapy even though patients on these
          immune modulators were on treatment longer. The better PRO profile
          further supports the clinical benefit of this treatment strategy for
          advanced cancer.
    AB  - IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: We conducted a systematic review
          and meta-analysis to compare patient-reported outcomes (PROs) of
          programmed death receptor-1/programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-1/PD-L1)
          inhibitors and standard-of-care therapy in patients with advanced
          cancer. PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors were associated with consistently
          smaller PRO score deterioration from baseline to follow-up for
          different health-related quality-of-life and symptoms scales. In
          addition, the time to deterioration in multiple PRO domains was
          significantly longer with PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors. Taken together,
          these findings indicate that the patients treated with PD-1/PD-L1
          inhibitors maintained health-related quality of life to a greater
          degree and had less symptom burden compared with those treated with
          standard-of-care therapy. Copyright &#xa9; AlphaMed Press 2018.

          evaluated the efficacy and safety of pembrolizumab in this
          population.
    AB  - PATIENTS AND METHODS: This randomized, double-blind, phase III
          study was conducted at 119 medical centers in 27 countries. Eligible
          patients with advanced HCC, previously treated with sorafenib, were
          randomly assigned at a two-to-one ratio to receive pembrolizumab
          plus best supportive care (BSC) or placebo plus BSC. Primary end
          points were overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival
          (PFS; one-sided significance thresholds, P = .0174 [final analysis]
          and P = .002 [first interim analysis], respectively). Safety was
          assessed in all patients who received >= 1 dose of study drug.
    AB  - RESULTS: Between May 31, 2016, and November 23, 2017, 413
          patients were randomly assigned. As of January 2, 2019, median
          follow-up was 13.8 months for pembrolizumab and 10.6 months for
          placebo. Median OS was 13.9 months (95% CI, 11.6 to 16.0 months) for
          pembrolizumab versus 10.6 months (95% CI, 8.3 to 13.5 months) for
          placebo (hazard ratio [HR], 0.781; 95% CI, 0.611 to 0.998; P =
          .0238). Median PFS for pembrolizumab was 3.0 months (95% CI, 2.8 to
          4.1 months) versus 2.8 months (95% CI, 2.5 to 4.1 months) for
          placebo at the first interim analysis (HR, 0.775; 95% CI, 0.609 to
          0.987; P = .0186) and 3.0 months (95% CI, 2.8 to 4.1 months) versus
          2.8 months (95% CI, 1.6 to 3.0 months) at final analysis (HR, 0.718;
          95% CI, 0.570 to 0.904; P = .0022). Grade 3 or higher adverse events
          occurred in 147 (52.7%) and 62 patients (46.3%) for pembrolizumab
          versus placebo; those that were treatment related occurred in 52
          (18.6%) and 10 patients (7.5%), respectively. No hepatitis C or B
          flares were identified.
    AB  - CONCLUSION: In this study, OS and PFS did not reach
          statistical significance per specified criteria. The results are
          consistent with those of KEYNOTE-224, supporting a favorable
          risk-to-benefit ratio for pembrolizumab in this population.

    AB  - PURPOSE: The National Cancer Institute Molecular Analysis for
          Therapy Choice (NCI-MATCH) trial, the largest national precision
          oncology study to date (> 1,100 sites) of patients with relapsed or
          refractory malignancies, assigned patients to targeted therapy in
          parallel phase II studies based on tumor molecular alterations. The
          anti-programmed death receptor 1 inhibitor nivolumab previously
          showed activity in mismatch repair (MMR)-deficient colon cancer. We
          hypothesized that nivolumab would have activity in patients with
          MMR-deficient, noncolorectal tumors.
    AB  - PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eligible patients with relapsed or
          refractory tumors, good end-organ function, and Eastern Cooperative
          Oncology Group performance status of <= 1 underwent tumor biopsy for
          centralized screening of molecular alterations. MMR deficiency was
          defined by complete loss of nuclear expression of MLH1 or MSH2 MMR
          gene products by immunohistochemistry (IHC). Patients with
          MMR-deficient colorectal cancer were excluded. Nivolumab, 3 mg/kg
          every 2 weeks (28-day cycles) and 480 mg every 4 weeks after cycle
          4, was administered intravenously. Disease reassessment was
          performed every 2 cycles. The primary end point was RECIST 1.1
          objective response rate (ORR).
    AB  - RESULTS: Two percent of 4,902 screened patients had an
          MMR-deficient cancer by IHC. Forty-two evaluable patients were
          enrolled, with a median age of 60 years and a median of 3 prior
          therapies. The most common histologies were endometrioid endometrial
          adenocarcinoma (n = 13), prostate adenocarcinoma (n = 5), and
          uterine carcinosarcoma (n = 4). ORR was 36% (15 of 42 patients). An
          additional 21% of patients had stable disease. The estimated 6-,
          12-, and 18-month progression-free survival rates were 51.3% (90%
          CI, 38.2% to 64.5%), 46.2% (90% CI, 33.1% to 59.3%), and 31.4% (90%
          CI, 18.7% to 44.2%), respectively. Median overall survival was 17.3
          months. Toxicity was predominantly low grade.
    AB  - CONCLUSION: A variety of refractory cancers (2.0% of those
          screened) had MMR deficiency as defined in NCI-MATCH. Nivolumab has
          promising activity in MMR-deficient noncolorectal cancers of a wide
          variety of histopathologic types.

    AB  - PURPOSE: In the phase 3 KEYNOTE-407 study, the addition of
          pembrolizumab to carboplatin-paclitaxel/nab-paclitaxel significantly
          improved overall survival, progression-free survival, and objective
          response rate in patients with previously untreated metastatic
          squamous non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), with little impact on
          severe toxicity. We present patient-reported outcomes (PROs) from
          KEYNOTE-407.
    AB  - METHODS: Patients were randomly assigned to receive 4 cycles
          of pembrolizumab 200 mg or placebo once every 3 weeks plus
          carboplatin plus paclitaxel or nab-paclitaxel, followed by
          pembrolizumab or placebo for an additional 31 cycles. Health-related
          quality of life (HRQoL) was evaluated using the European
          Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Treatment of
          Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire-Core 30 (QLQ-C30) and Quality
          of Life Questionnaire-Lung Cancer Module 13 (QLQ-LC13). Key PRO
          endpoints were change from baseline to weeks 9 and 18 (during and
          after platinum therapy) in the QLQ-C30 global health status/quality
          of life (GHS/QoL) score and time to deterioration in the composite
          endpoint of cough, chest pain, or dyspnea from the QLQ-C30 and
          QLQ-LC13. Two-sided, nominal P values are provided.
    AB  - RESULTS: A total of 554 and 553 patients completed >= 1
          QLQ-C30 or >= 1 QLQ-LC13 assessment, respectively. GHS/QoL score
          improved for the pembrolizumab-combination group (least squares [LS]
          mean [95% CI] change from baseline: week 9, 1.8 [-0.9 to 4.4]; week
          18, 4.3 [1.7 to 6.9]) and deteriorated in the placebo-combination
          group (week 9, -1.8 [-4.4 to 0.7]; week 18, -0.57 [-3.3 to 2.2]).
          Between-group differences were improved for the
          pembrolizumab-combination group (difference in LS mean scores: week
          9, 3.6 [95% CI, 0.3 to 6.9], nominal P = .0337; week 18, 4.9 [1.4 to
          8.3], nominal P = .0060). Median time to deterioration in cough,
          chest pain, or dyspnea was not reached in either group (hazard
          ratio, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.58 to 1.06]; nominal P = .125).
    AB  - CONCLUSION: Addition of pembrolizumab to chemotherapy
          maintained or improved HRQoL measurements relative to baseline and
          improved HRQoL versus chemotherapy alone at weeks 9 and 18. These
          results support use of pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy as first-line
          therapy for metastatic squamous NSCLC.

    AB  - BACKGROUND: In the ongoing, phase 3 PACIFIC trial, durvalumab
          improved the primary endpoints of progression-free survival and
          overall survival compared with that for placebo, with similar
          safety, in patients with unresectable, stage III non-small-cell lung
          cancer. In this analysis, we aimed to evaluate one of the secondary
          endpoints, patient-reported outcomes (PROs).
    AB  - METHODS: PACIFIC is an ongoing, international, multicentre,
          double-blind, randomised, controlled, phase 3 trial. Eligible
          patients were aged at least 18 years, had a WHO performance status
          of 0 or 1, with histologically or cytologically documented stage
          III, unresectable non-small-cell lung cancer, for which they had
          received at least two cycles of platinum-based chemoradiotherapy,
          with no disease progression after this treatment. We randomly
          assigned patients (2:1) using an interactive voice response system
          and a blocked design (block size=3) stratified by age, sex, and
          smoking history to receive 10 mg/kg intravenous durvalumab or
          matching placebo 1-42 days after concurrent chemoradiotherapy, then
          every 2 weeks up to 12 months. The primary endpoints of
          progression-free survival and overall survival have been reported
          previously. PROs were a prespecified secondary outcome. We assessed
          PRO symptoms, functioning, and global health status or quality of
          life in the intention-to-treat population with the European
          Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of
          Life Questionnaire-Core 30 (QLQ-C30) version 3 and its lung cancer
          module, the Quality of Life Questionnaire-Lung Cancer 13 (QLQ-LC13)
          at the time of random allocation to groups, at weeks 4 and 8, every
          8 weeks until week 48, and then every 12 weeks until progression.
          Changes from baseline to 12 month in key symptoms were analysed with
          mixed model for repeated measures (MMRM) and time-to-event analyses.
          A 10-point or greater change from baseline (deterioration or
          improvement) was deemed clinically relevant. This study is
          registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02125461, and EudraCT,
          2014-000336-42.
    AB  - FINDINGS: Between May 9, 2014, and April 22, 2016, 476
          patients were assigned to receive durvalumab, and 237 patients were
          assigned to receive placebo. As of March 22, 2018, the median
          follow-up was 25.2 months (IQR 14.1-29.5). More than 79% of patients
          given durvalumab and more than 82% of patients given placebo
          completed questionnaires up to week 48. Between baseline and 12
          months, the prespecified longitudinal PROs of interest, cough
          (MMRM-adjusted mean change 1.8 [95% CI 0.06 to 3.54] in the
          durvalumab group vs 0.7 [-1.91 to 3.30] in the placebo group),
          dyspnoea (3.1 [1.75 to 4.36] vs 1.4 [-0.51 to 3.34]), chest pain
          (-3.1 [-4.57 to -1.60] vs -3.5 [-5.68 to -1.29]), fatigue (-3.0
          [-4.53 to -1.50] vs -5.2 [-7.45 to -2.98]), appetite loss (-5.8
          [-7.28 to -4.36] vs -7.0 [-9.17 to -4.87]), physical functioning
          (0.1 [-1.10 to 1.28] vs 2.0 [0.22 to 3.73]), and global health
          status or quality of life (2.6 [1.21 to 3.94] vs 1.8 [-0.25 to
          3.81]) remained stable with both treatments, with no clinically
          relevant changes from baseline. The between-group differences in
          changes from baseline to 12 months in cough (difference in adjusted
          mean changes 1.1, 95% CI -1.89 to 4.11), dyspnoea (1.6, -0.58 to
          3.87), chest pain (0.4, -2.13 to 2.93), fatigue (2.2, -0.38 to
          4.78), appetite loss (1.2, -1.27 to 3.67), physical functioning
          (-1.9, -3.91 to 0.15), or global health status or quality of life
          (0.8, -1.55 to 3.14) were not clinically relevant. Generally, there
          were no clinically important between-group differences in time to
          deterioration of prespecified key PRO endpoints.
    AB  - INTERPRETATION: Our findings suggest that a clinical benefit
          with durvalumab can be attained without compromising PROs. This
          result is of note because the previous standard of care was
          observation alone, with no presumed detriment to PROs.

    AB  - BACKGROUND: Rationale exists for combined treatment with
          immune checkpoint inhibitors and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP)
          inhibitors in a variety of solid tumours. This study aimed to
          investigate the safety and antitumour effects of pamiparib, an oral
          PARP 1/2 inhibitor, combined with tislelizumab, a humanised
          anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody, in patients with advanced solid
          tumours and to determine the optimum doses for further evaluation.
    AB  - METHODS: We did a multicentre, open-label, phase 1a/b study at
          five academic sites or community oncology centres in Australia. We
          recruited adults (aged >=18 years) with advanced solid tumours who
          had received one or more previous lines of therapy, with an Eastern
          Cooperative Oncology Group performance score of 1 or less, and a
          life expectancy of 12 weeks or more. Patients were enrolled into one
          of five dose-escalation cohorts, with dose-escalation done in a 3 +
          3 design. Cohorts 1-3 received intravenous tislelizumab 2 mg/kg
          every 3 weeks plus 20, 40, or 60 mg oral pamiparib twice daily,
          respectively; cohorts 4 and 5 received 200 mg intravenous
          tislelizumab every 3 weeks plus 40 or 60 mg oral pamiparib twice
          daily, respectively. The primary endpoints of the phase 1a
          dose-escalation part of the study were safety and tolerability,
          including the occurrence of dose-limiting toxicities and
          determination of the maximum tolerated dose and recommended phase 2
          dose. All primary endpoints were analysed in the safety analysis
          set, which included all patients who received at least one dose of
          tislelizumab or pamiparib, with the exception of the occurrence of
          dose-limiting toxicities, which was analysed in the dose-limiting
          toxicity analysis set, which included all patients who received at
          least 90% of the first scheduled tislelizumab dose and at least 75%
          of scheduled pamiparib doses, or who had a dose-limiting toxicity
          event during cycle 1. Reported here are results of the phase 1a
          dose-escalation stage of the trial. This trial is registered with
          ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02660034, and is ongoing.
    AB  - FINDINGS: Between Jan 22, 2016, and May 16, 2017, we enrolled
          49 patients (median age 63 years [IQR 55-67]), all of whom received
          at least one dose of pamiparib or tiselzumab. Four patients had
          dose-limiting toxicities (intractable grade 2 nausea [n=1] and grade
          3 rash [n=1] in cohort 4, and grade 2 nausea and vomiting [n=1] and
          grade 4 immune-mediated hepatitis [n=1] in cohort 5). The
          recommended phase 2 dose was tislelizumab 200 mg every 3 weeks plus
          pamiparib 40 mg twice daily (the dose given in cohort 4). The most
          common treatment-emergent adverse events were nausea (in 31 [63%] of
          49 patients), fatigue (26 [53%]), diarrhoea (17 [35%]), and vomiting
          (15 [31%]). 23 (47%) of 49 patients had immune-related adverse
          events, of whom nine (39%) had asymptomatic grade 3-4 hepatic
          immune-related adverse events, which were reversible with
          corticosteroid treatment. The most common adverse event of grade 3
          or worse severity was anaemia (in six [12%] patients) and no grade 5
          adverse events were reported. Hepatitis or autoimmune hepatitis was
          the only serious adverse event to occur in two or more patients (in
          four [8%] patients). At a median follow-up of 8.3 months (IQR
          4.8-12.8), ten (20%) of 49 patients achieved an objective response
          according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST)
          version 1.1, including two complete responses and eight partial
          responses.
    AB  - INTERPRETATION: Pamiparib with tislelizumab was generally well
          tolerated and associated with antitumour responses and clinical
          benefit in patients with advanced solid tumours supporting further
          investigation of the combination of pamiparib with tislelizumab.

    AB  - BACKGROUND: Pembrolizumab improved progression-free survival
          and overall survival versus ipilimumab in patients with advanced
          melanoma and is now a standard of care in the first-line setting.
          However, the optimal duration of anti-PD-1 administration is
          unknown. We present results from 5 years of follow-up of patients in
          KEYNOTE-006.
    AB  - METHODS: KEYNOTE-006 was an open-label, multicentre,
          randomised, controlled, phase 3 study done at 87 academic
          institutions, hospitals, and cancer centres in 16 countries.
          Patients aged at least 18 years with Eastern Cooperative Oncology
          Group performance status of 0 or 1, ipilimumab-naive histologically
          confirmed advanced melanoma with known BRAFV600 status and up to one
          previous systemic therapy were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to
          intravenous pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks or every 3 weeks or
          four doses of intravenous ipilimumab 3 mg/kg every 3 weeks.
          Treatments were assigned using a centralised, computer-generated
          allocation schedule with blocked randomisation within strata.
          Exploratory combination of data from the two pembrolizumab dosing
          regimen groups was not protocol-specified. Pembrolizumab treatment
          continued for up to 24 months. Eligible patients who discontinued
          pembrolizumab with stable disease or better after receiving at least
          24 months of pembrolizumab or discontinued with complete response
          after at least 6 months of pembrolizumab and then progressed could
          receive an additional 17 cycles of pembrolizumab. Co-primary
          endpoints were overall survival and progression-free survival.
          Efficacy was analysed in all randomly assigned patients, and safety
          was analysed in all randomly assigned patients who received at least
          one dose of study treatment. Exploratory assessment of efficacy and
          safety at 5 years' follow-up was not specified in the protocol. Data
          cutoff for this analysis was Dec 3, 2018. Recruitment is closed; the
          study is ongoing. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov,
          number NCT01866319.
    AB  - FINDINGS: Between Sept 18, 2013, and March 3, 2014, 834
          patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to receive
          pembrolizumab (every 2 weeks, n=279; every 3 weeks, n=277), or
          ipilimumab (n=278). After a median follow-up of 57.7 months (IQR
          56.7-59.2) in surviving patients, median overall survival was 32.7
          months (95% CI 24.5-41.6) in the combined pembrolizumab groups and
          15.9 months (13.3-22.0) in the ipilimumab group (hazard ratio [HR]
          0.73, 95% CI 0.61-0.88, p=0.00049). Median progression-free survival
          was 8.4 months (95% CI 6.6-11.3) in the combined pembrolizumab
          groups versus 3.4 months (2.9-4.2) in the ipilimumab group (HR 0.57,
          95% CI 0.48-0.67, p<0.0001). Grade 3-4 treatment-related adverse
          events occurred in 96 (17%) of 555 patients in the combined
          pembrolizumab groups and in 50 (20%) of 256 patients in the
          ipilimumab group; the most common of these events were colitis (11
          [2%] vs 16 [6%]), diarrhoea (ten [2%] vs seven [3%]), and fatigue
          (four [<1%] vs three [1%]). Any-grade serious treatment-related
          adverse events occurred in 75 (14%) patients in the combined
          pembrolizumab groups and in 45 (18%) patients in the ipilimumab
          group. One patient assigned to pembrolizumab died from
          treatment-related sepsis.
    AB  - INTERPRETATION: Pembrolizumab continued to show superiority
          over ipilimumab after almost 5 years of follow-up. These results
          provide further support for use of pembrolizumab in patients with
          advanced melanoma.

    AB  - PURPOSE: KEYNOTE-164 (NCT02460198) evaluated the antitumor
          activity of pembrolizumab in previously treated, metastatic,
          microsatellite instability-high/mismatch repair-deficient
          (MSI-H/dMMR) colorectal cancer (CRC).
    AB  - METHODS: This phase II open-label study involved 128 centers
          worldwide. Eligible patients were age >= 18 years and had metastatic
          MSI-H/dMMR CRC treated with >= 2 prior lines of standard therapy,
          including fluoropyrimidine, oxaliplatin, and irinotecan with or
          without anti-vascular endothelial growth factor/epidermal growth
          factor receptor monoclonal antibody (cohort A) or >= 1 prior line of
          therapy (cohort B). MSI-H/dMMR status was assessed locally. Patients
          received pembrolizumab 200 mg every 3 weeks for up to 2 years until
          progression, unacceptable toxicity, or withdrawal. The primary end
          point was objective response rate by RECIST version 1.1 by
          independent central review. Secondary end points were duration of
          response, progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival, safety,
          and tolerability.
    AB  - RESULTS: A total of 124 patients with MSI-H/dMMR CRC (61 in
          cohort A, 63 in cohort B) enrolled. At data cutoff, median follow-up
          was 31.3 months (range, 0.2-35.6 months) for cohort A and 24.2
          months (range, 0.1-27.1 months) for cohort B. Objective response
          rate was 33% (95% CI, 21% to 46%) and 33% (95% CI, 22% to 46%),
          respectively, with median duration of response not reached in either
          cohort. Median PFS was 2.3 months (95% CI, 2.1 to 8.1 months) and
          4.1 months (95% CI, 2.1 to 18.9 months). Median overall survival was
          31.4 months (95% CI, 21.4 months to not reached) and not reached
          (95% CI, 19.2 months to not reached). Treatment-related grade 3-4
          adverse events occurred in 10 patients (16%) in cohort A and 8 (13%)
          in cohort B, with the most common occurring in >= 2 patients being
          pancreatitis, fatigue, increased alanine aminotransferase, and
          increased lipase (2 patients each; 3%) in cohort A.
    AB  - CONCLUSION: Pembrolizumab is effective with a manageable
          safety profile in patients with MSI-H/dMMR CRC.

    AB  - PURPOSE: In this multicenter phase II trial, we evaluated
          atezolizumab combined with bevacizumab in patients with advanced
          renal cell carcinoma (RCC) with variant histology or any RCC
          histology with >= 20% sarcomatoid differentiation.
    AB  - PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eligible patients may have received
          previous systemic therapy, excluding prior bevacizumab or checkpoint
          inhibitors. Patients underwent a baseline biopsy and received
          atezolizumab 1,200 mg and bevacizumab 15 mg/kg intravenously every 3
          weeks. The primary end point was overall response rate (ORR) by
          RECIST version 1.1. Additional end points were progression-free
          survival (PFS), toxicity, biomarkers of response as determined by
          programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) status, and on-therapy
          quality-of-life (QOL) metrics using the Functional Assessment of
          Cancer Therapy Kidney Symptom Index-19 and the Brief Fatigue
          Inventory.
    AB  - RESULTS: Sixty patients received at least 1 dose of either
          study agent; the majority (65%) were treatment naive. The ORR for
          the overall population was 33% and 50% in patients with clear cell
          RCC with sarcomatoid differentiation and 26% in patients with
          variant histology RCC. Median PFS was 8.3 months (95% CI, 5.7 to
          10.9 months). PD-L1 status was available for 36 patients; 15 (42%)
          had >= 1% expression on tumor cells. ORR in PD-L1-positive patients
          was 60% (n = 9) v 19% (n = 4) in PD-L1-negative patients. Eight
          patients (13%) developed treatment-related grade 3 toxicities. There
          were no treatment-related grade 4-5 toxicities. QOL was maintained
          throughout therapy.
    AB  - CONCLUSION: In this study, atezolizumab and bevacizumab
          demonstrated safety and resulted in objective responses in patients
          with variant histology RCC or RCC with >= 20% sarcomatoid
          differentiation. This regimen warrants additional exploration in
          patients with rare RCC, particularly those with PD-L1-positive
          tumors.

    AB  - Stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has a dismal
          prognosis, with only 15-20% of patients alive at 5 years after
          concomitant chemo-radiotherapy, which represents the standard
          treatment. Targeting immune-checkpoint inhibitors represents a
          standard option for advanced NSCLC. Improvements in understanding of
          the immune profile of NSCLC has led to the development of
          immunotherapeutic strategies, including inhibitory molecules
          responsible for abrogating an anticancer immune response such as
          programmed cell-death 1 and programmed cell-death ligand 1. A
          recently published phase III trial (PACIFIC) showed for the first
          time an improved overall survival in stage III NSCLC patients with
          consolidative durvalumab. The aim of this review is to summarize and
          discuss the clinical evidence for the use of durvalumab in stage III
          NSCLC, with a brief overview on future perspectives in this setting.

    AB  - PURPOSE: Genomes of tumors that are deficient in DNA mismatch
          repair (dMMR) have high microsatellite instability (MSI-H) and
          harbor hundreds to thousands of somatic mutations that encode
          potential neoantigens. Such tumors are therefore likely to be
          immunogenic, triggering upregulation of immune checkpoint proteins.
          Pembrolizumab, an anti-programmed death-1 monoclonal antibody, has
          antitumor activity against MSI-H/dMMR cancer. We report data from
          the phase II KEYNOTE-158 study of pembrolizumab in patients with
          previously treated, advanced noncolorectal MSI-H/dMMR cancer.
    AB  - PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eligible patients with
          histologically/cytologically confirmed MSI-H/dMMR advanced
          noncolorectal cancer who experienced failure with prior therapy
          received pembrolizumab 200 mg once every 3 weeks for 2 years or
          until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or patient
          withdrawal. Radiologic imaging was performed every 9 weeks for the
          first year of therapy and every 12 weeks thereafter. The primary end
          point was objective response rate per Response Evaluation Criteria
          in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1, as assessed by independent
          central radiologic review.
    AB  - RESULTS: Among 233 enrolled patients, 27 tumor types were
          represented, with endometrial, gastric, cholangiocarcinoma, and
          pancreatic cancers being the most common. Median follow up was 13.4
          months. Objective response rate was 34.3% (95% CI, 28.3% to 40.8%).
          Median progression-free survival was 4.1 months (95% CI, 2.4 to 4.9
          months) and median overall survival was 23.5 months (95% CI, 13.5
          months to not reached). Treatment-related adverse events occurred in
          151 patients (64.8%). Thirty-four patients (14.6%) had grade 3 to 5
          treatment-related adverse events. Grade 5 pneumonia occurred in one
          patient; there were no other treatment-related fatal adverse events.
    AB  - CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrates the clinical benefit of
          anti-programmed death-1 therapy with pembrolizumab among patients
          with previously treated unresectable or metastatic MSI-H/dMMR
          noncolorectal cancer. Toxicity was consistent with previous
          experience of pembrolizumab monotherapy.

    AB  - PURPOSE: Adrenocortical carcinomas (ACC) are rare and
          aggressive malignancies with limited treatment options. This study
          was undertaken to evaluate the immunogenicity of ACC.
    AB  - PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with advanced ACC were enrolled
          in a phase II study to evaluate the clinical activity of
          pembrolizumab 200 mg every 3 weeks, without restriction on prior
          therapy. The primary end point was objective response rate. Efficacy
          was correlated with tumor programmed death-ligand 1 expression,
          microsatellite-high and/or mismatch repair deficient (MSI-H/MMR-D)
          status, and somatic and germline genomic correlates.
    AB  - RESULTS: We enrolled 39 patients with advanced ACC and herein
          report after a median follow-up of 17.8 months (range, 5.4 months to
          34.7 months). The objective response rate to pembrolizumab was 23%
          (nine patients; 95% CI, 11% to 39%), and the disease control rate
          was 52% (16 patients; 95% CI, 33% to 69%). The median duration of
          response was not reached (lower 95% CI, 4.1 months). Two of six
          patients with MSI-H/MMR-D tumors responded. The other seven patients
          with objective responses had microsatellite stable tumors. The
          median progression-free survival was 2.1 months (95% CI, 2.0 months
          to 10.7 months), and the median overall survival was 24.9 months
          (95% CI, 4.2 months to not reached). Thirteen percent of patients (n
          = 5) had treatment-related grade 3 or 4 adverse events. Tumor
          programmed death-ligand 1 expression and MSI-H/MMR-D status were not
          associated with objective response.
    AB  - CONCLUSION: MSI-H/MMR-D tumors, for which pembrolizumab is a
          standard therapy, are more common in ACC than has been recognized.
          In advanced ACC that is microsatellite stable, pembrolizumab
          provided clinically meaningful and durable antitumor activity with a
          manageable safety profile.

    AB  - PURPOSE: To assess the efficacy of pembrolizumab in patients
          with advanced relapsed or refractory mycosis fungoides (MF) or
          Sezary syndrome (SS).
    AB  - PATIENTS AND METHODS: CITN-10 is a single-arm, multicenter
          phase II trial of 24 patients with advanced MF or SS. Patients were
          treated with pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg every 3 weeks for up to 24
          months. The primary end point was overall response rate by consensus
          global response criteria.
    AB  - RESULTS: Patients had advanced-stage disease (23 of 24 with
          stage IIB to IV MF/SS) and were heavily pretreated with a median of
          four prior systemic therapies. The overall response rate was 38%
          with two complete responses and seven partial responses. Of the nine
          responding patients, six had 90% or more improvement in skin disease
          by modified Severity Weighted Assessment Tool, and eight had ongoing
          responses at last follow-up. The median duration of response was not
          reached, with a median response follow-up time of 58 weeks.
          Immune-related adverse events led to treatment discontinuation in
          four patients. A transient worsening of erythroderma and pruritus
          occurred in 53% of patients with SS. This cutaneous flare reaction
          did not result in treatment discontinuation for any patient. The
          flare reaction correlated with high PD-1 expression on Sezary cells
          but did not associate with subsequent clinical responses or lack of
          response. Treatment responses did not correlate with expression of
          PD-L1, total mutation burden, or an interferon-gamma gene expression
          signature.
    AB  - CONCLUSION: Pembrolizumab demonstrated significant antitumor
          activity with durable responses and a favorable safety profile in
          patients with advanced MF/SS.

    AB  - PURPOSE: Primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma (PMBL) is a rare
          but aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma with poor outcomes in patients
          with relapsed/refractory (R/R) disease. PMBL is characterized by
          high expression of programmed death-1 ligand and variable expression
          of CD30. Nivolumab, an anti-programmed death-1 immune checkpoint
          inhibitor, and brentuximab vedotin (BV), an anti-CD30 antibody-drug
          conjugate, may have synergistic activity in R/R PMBL.
    AB  - METHODS: The expansion cohort of the open-label, phase I/II
          CheckMate 436 study enrolled patients with confirmed R/R PMBL who
          were previously treated with either autologous hematopoietic cell
          transplantation or two or more prior chemotherapy regimens if
          ineligible for autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation.
          Patients received nivolumab (240 mg intravenously) and BV (1.8 mg/kg
          intravenously) every 3 weeks until disease progression or
          unacceptable toxicity. Primary end points were investigator-assessed
          objective response rate (ORR) per the Lugano 2014 criteria and
          safety.
    AB  - RESULTS: Thirty patients with PMBL were treated and evaluable.
          At a median follow-up of 11.1 months, ORR (95% CI) was 73% (54% to
          88%), with a 37% complete remission rate per investigator, and ORR
          of 70% (51% to 85%), with a 43% complete metabolic response rate per
          independent review. Median duration of response, median
          progression-free survival, and median overall survival have not been
          reached. Eleven responders had consolidation with autologous (n = 5)
          or allogeneic (n = 6) transplantation. Treatment-related adverse
          events were reported in 25 patients (83%). Sixteen patients (53%)
          had grade 3 to 4 treatment-related adverse events; the most common
          were neutropenia (n = 9), thrombocytopenia (n = 3), and peripheral
          neuropathy (n = 3). There were no treatment-related deaths.
    AB  - CONCLUSION: In patients with R/R PMBL, the combination of
          nivolumab plus BV represents a promising option, with high antitumor
          activity and a manageable safety profile.

    AB  - Management of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma is
          challenging. With an increasing number of options for the first and
          second-line treatment, understanding and developing optimal systemic
          treatment strategies are crucial. In second line, two tyrosine
          kinase inhibitors (TKI) and one monoclonal antibody have been
          approved after sorafenib by both the European Medicines Agency and
          the Food and Drug Administration based on the results of phase 3
          trials: cabozantinib, regorafenib and ramucirumab. Cabozantinib has
          demonstrated an improved overall survival and progression-free
          survival in the phase 3 CELESTIAL study in second and third line, in
          patients in good general condition (performance status 0-1) and with
          a normal liver function Child-Pugh class A. Analysis of subgroups
          has shown that even elderly patients over 65 years, or patients with
          high baseline alpha-fetoprotein >=400 ng/mL benefit from
          cabozantinib. The choice in second-line between the three drugs
          should be based on factors such as previous tolerance of sorafenib,
          safety profile of drugs and quality of life. In this review, we will
          analyze clinical data available on cabozantinib, clarifying the
          choice between the different possible treatments. However, the
          upcoming of a new standard in first line with the combination
          atezolizumab and bevacizumab will change the game and will warrant
          further investigations to define the accurate subsequent sequence of
          TKIs. Cabozantinib is also actually tested in first-line in
          combination with atezolizumab, results of the phase 3 COSMIC trial
          are eagerly awaited. Copyright &#xa9; 2020 Debaillon Vesque et al.

    AB  - Objective: This review aimed to assess the quality of
          available evidence on the economic evaluations of immune checkpoint
          inhibitors in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and
          provide evidence to improve the efficiency of healthcare resources.
    AB  - Materials and Methods: Literature search was performed using
          some electronic databases (PubMed, Embase and Cochrane Central
          Register of Controlled Trials). Final search was performed in
          December 2019. Study characteristics and results were recorded and
          compared. The quality of the studies was assessed using the
          Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards (CHEERS)
          checklists. We did not elaborate the restrictions on the target
          population. We included patients with squamous or non-squamous NSCLC
          and metastatic or advanced cancer.
    AB  - Results: Of 98 papers considered, 21 were chosen for this
          review. Most of them are cost-effectiveness analysis. Comparative
          regimens consisted of either immune checkpoint inhibitor
          monotherapy, immune checkpoint inhibitor plus chemotherapy, or
          chemotherapy alone. Fourteen, four, and three studies were about
          pembrolizumab, nivolumab, and atezolizumab, respectively. The
          methods mostly used in these studies were modeling and sensitivity
          analysis. All studies used quality-adjusted life year (QALY) and
          life years (LY) as outcomes. Most studies were conducted in
          high-income countries. Based on the willingness to pay threshold,
          atezolizumab, and pembrolizumab were found to be cost-effective in
          one and 10 studies, respectively. None of the studies concluded that
          nivolumab was cost-effective. For quality assessment, all studies
          fulfilled more than 50% of the CHEERS checklist.
    AB  - Conclusion: The included studies indicated that pembrolizumab
          regimens are cost-effective as first-line treatment for patients
          with NSCLC in developed countries. Nivolumab and atezolizumab are
          likely to be cost-effective as second-line treatment but not as
          first-line treatment. Copyright &#xa9; 2020 Li et al.

    AB  - Cancer nanomedicines have shown promise in combination
          immunotherapy, thus far mostly preclinically but also already in
          clinical trials. Combining nanomedicines with immunotherapy aims to
          reinforce the cancer-immunity cycle, via potentiating key steps in
          the immune reaction cascade, namely antigen release, antigen
          processing, antigen presentation, and immune cell-mediated killing.
          Combination nano-immunotherapy can be realized via three targeting
          strategies, i.e., by targeting cancer cells, targeting the tumor
          immune microenvironment, and targeting the peripheral immune system.
          The clinical potential of nano-immunotherapy has recently been
          demonstrated in a phase III trial in which nano-albumin paclitaxel
          (Abraxane R) was combined with atezolizumab (Tecentriq R) for the
          treatment of patients suffering from advanced triple-negative breast
          cancer. In the present paper, besides strategies and initial
          (pre)clinical success stories, we also discuss several key
          challenges in nano-immunotherapy. Taken together, nanomedicines
          combined with immunotherapy are gaining significant attention, and
          it is anticipated that they will play an increasingly important role
          in clinical cancer therapy.

          improved progression-free survival with atezolizumab plus
          bevacizumab vs sunitinib in patients with programmed death-ligand 1
          (PD-L1)+ tumours and suggested activity of atezolizumab monotherapy
          in previously untreated metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC).
    AB  - PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with previously untreated mRCC
          were randomised to atezolizumab 1200 mg intravenously (i.v.) every 3
          weeks (n = 103), the atezolizumab regimen plus bevacizumab 15 mg/kg
          i.v. every 3 weeks (n = 101), or sunitinib 50 mg orally daily (4
          weeks on, 2 weeks off; n = 101). The MD Anderson Symptom Inventory
          (MDASI) and Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI) were administered on days
          1 and 22 of each 6-week cycle. Time to deterioration (TTD), change
          from baseline in MDASI core and RCC symptom severity, interference
          with daily life, and BFI fatigue severity and interference scores
          were reported for all comers. The TTD was the first >=2-point score
          increase over baseline. Absolute effect size >=0.2 suggested a
          clinically important difference with checkpoint inhibitor therapy vs
          sunitinib.
    AB  - RESULTS: Completion rates were >90% at baseline and >=80% at
          most visits. Delayed TTD in core and RCC symptoms, symptom
          interference, fatigue, and fatigue-related interference was observed
          with atezolizumab (both alone and in combination) vs sunitinib.
          Improved TTD (hazard ratio [HR], 95% confidence interval [CI]) was
          more pronounced with atezolizumab monotherapy: core symptoms, 0.39
          (0.22-0.71); RCC symptoms, 0.22 (0.12-0.41); and symptom
          interference, 0.36 (0.22-0.58). Change from baseline by visit,
          evaluated by the MDASI, also showed a trend favouring atezolizumab
          monotherapy vs sunitinib. Small sample sizes may have limited the
          ability to draw definitive conclusions.
    AB  - CONCLUSION: PROs suggested that atezolizumab alone or with
          bevacizumab maintained daily function compared with sunitinib.
          Notably, symptoms were least severe with atezolizumab alone vs
          sunitinib (IMmotion150; ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01984242).

    AB  - PURPOSE: Patients with persistent/recurrent cervical cancer
          following platinum-based chemotherapy have limited therapeutic
          options. The Gynecologic-Oncology-Group conducted a phase II trial
          to assess efficacy and tolerability of nivolumab, an immune
          checkpoint inhibitor, in persistent/recurrent cervical carcinoma.
    AB  - PATIENTS AND METHODS: Key eligibility criteria included
          persistent/recurrent cervical cancer, failure of prior systemic
          therapy and ECOG PS 0-1. Nivolumab 3 mg/kg was given IV every 2 wk.
          until disease progression or intolerable toxicity. Response was
          assessed every 8 wk. for 6 months and every 12 wk. thereafter. The
          primary endpoints were objective response as assessed by RECIST 1.1.
          The study used a 2-stage group sequential design. PD-L1 expression
          was evaluated in tumor specimens by immunohistochemistry (IHC) using
          a combined-positive-score (CPS) cutoff of >=1%.
    AB  - RESULTS: Of 26 enrolled patients with persistent/recurrent
          cervical cancer, 25 were evaluable for response/toxicity with a
          median age of 45. 36% had ECOG PS of 1, and 100% had received one
          prior systemic chemotherapy regimen. PD-L1 expression (>=1%) was
          identified in 77.3% of tumor samples. As of 03/05/19, all patients
          were off study treatment; median follow-up for survival status was
          32 months (range, 2-41.5). There were 21 (84%) patients with a
          treatment-related adverse event (TRAE) and most were grades 1-2. Six
          (24%) patients had grade 3 TRAEs with 1 discontinuing nivolumab due
          to hepatic toxicity. No grade 5 TRAEs occurred, and 2 patients had
          grade 4 TRAEs. One confirmed partial response (4%; 90% CI,
          0.4%-22.9%), duration of response 3.8 months. Thirty-six percent of
          patients had stable disease (SD) (9/25; 90% CI, 20.2%-54.4%); the
          median duration of SD was 5.7 months (range, 3.5-12.7). Estimated
          PFS and OS at 6 months were 16% and 78.4%, respectively.
    AB  - CONCLUSION: Single agent nivolumab exhibited low antitumor
          activity and an acceptable safety profile in patients with
          persistent/recurrent cervical cancer previously treated with
          platinum-based chemotherapy. Copyright &#xa9; 2019 Elsevier Inc. All

    AB  - Pancreatic cancer affects both male and female individuals
          with higher incidences and death rates among the male population.
          Detection of this malignancy is delayed due to the lack of symptoms
          in the early-stage cancer, which makes it extremely difficult to
          treat. Identifying effective strategies has been a challenge for
          improving the survival rates in pancreatic cancer patients.
          Resistance to chemotherapy is often developed in pancreatic cancer
          treatment. Although many strategies are under clinical trials to
          target certain markers associated with cancer, immunotherapeutic
          approaches are currently gaining importance. Immunotherapy for
          pancreatic cancer is in the limelight after preclinical research
          showed some promise. Immunotherapy approaches were tested along with
          other treatment options to enhance the treatment effect. Adoptive
          cell transfer and immune checkpoint inhibitors are currently in
          clinical trials. The Food and Drug Administration approved
          pembrolizumab in a fast-tracked review for advanced pancreatic
          cancer patients. Pembrolizumab blocks the checkpoint protein,
          programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1), on T cells to boost the
          response of the immune system against cancer cells, thereby
          shrinking tumors. The recent developments in immunotherapy and the
          early success in other cancers are encouraging to further test
          immunotherapy in pancreatic cancer. The combination of pembrolizumab
          and pelareorep, an isolate of human reovirus, is in phase II
          clinical study in metastatic disease. Depending on the results of
          current clinical trials and testing, the strategies in the pipeline
          are expected to increase the use of immunotherapy in the clinical
          testing setting. Success in immunotherapy is urgently needed to
          address the side-effects, treating patients with advanced disease
          and reducing metastasis for increasing the survival rate in
          pancreatic cancer patients.

    AB  - Three drug combinations, ipilimumab-nivolumab (Ipi-Nivo),
          pembrolizumab-axitinib (Pembro-Axi), and avelumab-axitinib
          (Ave-Axi), have received regulatory approval in the USA and Europe
          for the treatment of metastatic renal cell carcinoma with clear cell
          component (mRCC). However, no head-to-head comparison data are
          available to identify the best option. Therefore, we aimed to
          compare these new treatments in a first-line setting. We conducted a
          systematic search in PubMed, the Cochrane Library, and
          clinicaltrials.gov for any randomized controlled trials of
          treatment-naive patients with mRCC, from January 2015 to October
          2019. The process was performed according to PRISMA guidelines. We
          performed a Bayesian network meta-analysis with two different
          approaches, a contrast-based model comparing HRs and ORs between
          studies and arm-based using parametric modeling. The outcomes for
          the analysis were overall survival, progression-free survival (PFS),
          and objective response rate. Our search identified 3 published phase
          3 randomized clinical trials (2835 patients). In the contrast-based
          model, Ave-Axi (SUCRA = 83%) and Pembro-Axi (SUCRA = 80%) exhibited
          the best ranking probabilities for PFS. For overall survival (OS),
          Pembro-Axi (SUCRA = 96%) was the most preferable option against
          Ave-Axi and Ipi-Nivo. Objective response rate analysis showed
          Ave-Axi as the best (SUCRA: 94%) and Pembro-Axi as the second best
          option. In the parametric models, the risk of progression was
          comparable for Ave-Axi and Ipi-Nivo, whereas Pembro-Axi exhibited a
          lower risk during the first 6 months of treatment and a higher risk
          afterwards. Furthermore, Pembro-Axi exhibited a net advantage in
          terms of OS over the two other regimens, while Ave-Axi was the least
          preferable option. Overall evidence suggests that pembrolizumab plus
          axitinib seems to have a slight advantage over the other two
          combinations.

    AB  - BACKGROUND: Histological transformation of oncogene-driven
          lung adenocarcinoma to small cell lung cancer (SCLC) following
          treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) is a well-described
          phenomenon. Whether a similar transformation may drive acquired
          resistance to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICPIs) in non-SCLC
          (NSCLC) is uncertain. Hence, tissue biopsies are not universally
          recommended at progression of NSCLC on ICPIs, unlike TKIs.
    AB  - CASE PRESENTATION: We report a case of a woman in her mid-60s
          with a 35 pack-years tobacco history and stage IV squamous cell lung
          carcinoma with no targetable genomic alterations, whose disease
          progressed within 4 months of first line carboplatin/gemcitabine
          therapy. Her treatment was switched to second line nivolumab
          monotherapy which resulted in sustained partial response lasting 21
          months. She subsequently developed rapid, bulky progression of
          mediastinal disease. Biopsy showed transformation to SCLC.
          Comparison of genomic profiling results from the initial NSCLC
          diagnosis and SCLC transformation revealed near-identical tumor
          profiles. Her disease responded to next line carboplatin/etoposide,
          though lasting for only 10 months. She died 14 months after
          detection of neuroendocrine transformation of her NSCLC.
    AB  - SYSTEMATIC REVIEW: We performed a systematic review of the
          literature to identify similar cases of NSCLC-to-small cell
          transformation on ICPIs. Nine patients, including our index case,
          were identified, with seven (77.8%) on nivolumab and two (22.2%) on
          pembrolizumab monotherapy. Median survival time since small cell
          transformation was 13.0 months (95% CI 2.0 to 16.0). Using our
          patient case as a framework, we further discuss the lack of
          consensus criteria to distinguish small cell transformation from de
          novo metachronous SCLC.
    AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Histological transformation to SCLC is a
          potential mechanism of acquired resistance to ICPIs in NSCLC. Repeat
          tissue biopsies should be considered at the time of progression,
          similar to oncogene-directed therapies. Prospective larger studies
          are warranted to further characterize NSCLC-to-small cell
          transformation on ICPIs using molecular fingerprinting with paired
          tumor genomic profiles, evaluation of neuroendocrine features at
          baseline and consideration of initial response. Copyright &#xa9;

    AB  - BACKGROUND: Inflammatory mediators, including acute phase
          reactants and cytokines, have been reported to be associated with
          clinical efficacy in patients with melanoma and other cancers
          receiving immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI). Analyses of patient
          sera from three large phase II/III randomized ICI trials, one of
          which included a chemotherapy arm, were performed to assess whether
          baseline levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6) or
          neutrophil/lymphocyte (N/L) ratios were prognostic or predictive.
    AB  - PATIENTS AND METHODS: Baseline and on-treatment sera were
          analyzed by multiplex protein assays from immunotherapy-naive
          patients with metastatic melanoma randomized 1:1 on the
          Checkmate-064 phase II trial of sequential administration of
          nivolumab followed by ipilimumab or the reverse sequence. Baseline
          sera, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells using automated cell
          counting, were analyzed from treatment-naive patients who were BRAF
          wild-type and randomly allocated 1:1 to receive nivolumab or
          dacarbazine on the phase III Checkmate-066 trial, and from
          treatment-naive patients allocated 1:1:1 to receive nivolumab,
          ipilimumab or both ipilimumab and nivolumab on the phase III
          Checkmate-067 trial.
    AB  - RESULTS: Higher baseline levels of IL-6 and the N/L ratio, and
          to a lesser degree, CRP were associated with shorter survival in
          patients receiving ICI or chemotherapy. Increased on-treatment
          levels of IL-6 in patients on the Checkmate-064 study were also
          associated with shorter survival. IL-6 levels from patients on
          Checkmate-064, Checkmate-066 and Checkmate-067 were highly
          correlated with levels of CRP and the N/L ratio.
    AB  - CONCLUSION: IL-6, CRP and the N/L ratio are prognostic factors
          with higher levels associated with shorter overall survival in
          patients with metastatic melanoma receiving ICI or chemotherapy in
          large randomized trials. In a multi-variable analysis of the
          randomized phase III Checkmate-067 study, IL-6 was a significant
          prognostic factor for survival. Copyright &#xa9; Author(s) (or their

    AB  - BACKGROUND: The systemic treatment of metastatic melanoma has
          improved considerably with the introduction of new, targeted
          substances and immune checkpoint inhibitors. This article presents
          treatment options for advanced inoperable melanoma and in the
          setting of adjuvant treatment after complete metastasectomy.
    AB  - METHODS: The data for analysis were derived from a selective
          literature search in PubMed and a search for systematic reviews in
          the Cochrane Library.
    AB  - RESULTS: Immune checkpoint inhibitors, which target the
          cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen or the "programmed death" (PD)
          receptor, activate T-cells and other immune cells, so that the
          body's own immune system attacks the melanoma. In unselected
          patients, immune checkpoint inhibition using nivolumab improved
          overall survival compared with dacarbazine (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.42;
          P<0.001). The antibody pem- brolizumab also led to better overall
          survival than ipilimumab (HR 0.68; P<0.001). Combination treatment
          with anti-CTLA-4 and anti-PD-1 antibodies improved overall survival
          even more than ipilimumab monotherapy, albeit at the cost of greater
          toxic- ity (HR 0.55; P<0.001). Another treatment approach aims to
          inhibit intracellular signal transduction in the melanoma cells. For
          patients with a BRAF-V66 mutation, combination treatments with
          BRAF/MEK inhibitors led to a rapid response in most cases (64-75%).
          In principle, the novel treatments are also effective in patients
          with cerebral metastases. In the adjuvant setting, both immune
          checkpoint inhibitors and BRAF/MEK inhibitors reduced the risk of
          recurrence by about 50%.
    AB  - CONCLUSION: High-quality studies show that the new substances
          are clinically effective in the palliative and adjuvant treatment of
          melanoma.

    AB  - BACKGROUND: Inhibitors of programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) and
          its ligand (PD-L1) have been increasingly used in head and neck
          cancer therapy and reported to improve the outcomes with an
          acceptable safety profile. This systematic review and meta-analysis
          was conducted to assess the benefit and risk of PD-1/PD-L1
          inhibitors in patients with head and neck cancer.
    AB  - METHOD: The PubMed, Cochrane Library, EMBASE and Web of
          Science databases were systematically searched to find potentially
          eligible studies up to May 30, 2019. Primary outcomes were overall
          survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), objective response
          rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR) and adverse events.
    AB  - RESULTS: Overall, this analysis consisted of nine eligible
          studies, with two randomized controlled trials and seven single arm
          trials. In the treatment of recurrent or metastatic head and neck
          cancer, PD-1 inhibitors showed significantly lower relative risk of
          death than standard-of-care therapy (odds ratio [OR] = 0.60, 95%
          confidence interval [CI]: 0.44-0.82, I2 = 0%, P = .001). Programmed
          cell death-1 inhibitors also decreased the risk of disease
          progression, however, there was no statistically significant
          difference of PFS between the treatments (OR = 0.69, 95% CI:
          0.48-1.01, I2 = 0%, P = .05). Subgroup analysis showed that human
          papillomavirus (HPV) positive patients had higher response rates
          than HPV negative patients in PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors-treated
          population (ORR: 18.8% vs 12.2%; DCR: 42.8% vs 34.4%). The most
          common any-grade and grade >=3 treatment-related adverse events were
          fatigue (14.7%, 95% CI: 12.3%-17.1%) and aspartate aminotransferase
          increased (1.6%, 95% CI: 0.3%-2.9%), respectively.
    AB  - CONCLUSION: Programmed cell death-1 inhibitors prolonged OS in
          comparison with standard-of-care therapy in recurrent or metastatic
          head and neck cancer patients. Human papillomavirus positive
          patients were superior to HPV negative patients in the treatment of
          PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors. More phase III randomized controlled trials
          are warranted to confirm our findings. Copyright &#xa9; 2019 The

    AB  - BACKGROUND: Systemic cancer therapies may induce infusion
          reactions (IRs) or hypersensitivities. Metastatic colorectal cancer
          (mCRC) patients treated with anti-EGFR therapies, including
          cetuximab and panitumumab, may be subject to these reactions. We
          conducted a meta-analysis to estimate the IR incidence in this
          population and identify variations in this incidence by patient or
          study characteristics.
    AB  - METHODS: A systematic review was conducted to identify
          observational studies or clinical trials of mCRC patients treated
          with anti-EGFR therapies that reported occurrences of IRs,
          hypersensitivity, or allergy/anaphylaxis. The objective of the study
          was to estimate the incidence of IRs. Random effects models were
          used to meta-analyze the incidence of IRs overall and stratified by
          therapy type, study design, geographic location, RAS or KRAS
          mutation status, grade of reaction severity, and terminology used to
          describe the reaction.
    AB  - RESULTS: The pooled estimate for IR incidence was 4.9% (95%
          confidence interval: 3.6%-6.5%). Lower-grade reactions were more
          common than higher-grade reactions overall and the incidence of
          reactions among cetuximab patients was nearly four times that of
          panitumumab patients (6.1% vs 1.6%).
    AB  - CONCLUSIONS: IRs occur in approximately 5% of mCRC patients
          treated with anti-EGFR therapies, and the incidence varies
          significantly by grade of severity and therapy type. Studies
          evaluating these outcomes should consider investigating survival
          outcomes by IR status to determine its prognostic relevance.

    AB  - BACKGROUND: Dual blockade of PD-L1 and VEGF has enhanced
          anticancer immunity through multiple mechanisms and augmented
          antitumour activity in multiple malignancies. We aimed to assess the
          efficacy and safety of atezolizumab (anti-PD-L1) alone and combined
          with bevacizumab (anti-VEGF) in patients with unresectable
          hepatocellular carcinoma.
    AB  - METHODS: GO30140 is an open-label, multicentre, multiarm,
          phase 1b study that enrolled patients at 26 academic centres and
          community oncology practices in seven countries worldwide. The study
          included five cohorts, and the two hepatocellular carcinoma cohorts,
          groups A and F, are described here. Inclusion criteria for these two
          groups included age 18 years and older; histologically,
          cytologically, or clinically (per American Association for the Study
          of Liver Diseases criteria) confirmed unresectable hepatocellular
          carcinoma that was not amenable to curative treatment; no previous
          systemic treatment; and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group
          performance status of 0 or 1. In group A, all patients received
          atezolizumab (1200 mg) and bevacizumab (15 mg/kg) intravenously
          every 3 weeks. In group F, patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to
          receive intravenous atezolizumab (1200 mg) plus intravenous
          bevacizumab (15 mg/kg) every 3 weeks or atezolizumab alone by
          interactive voice-web response system using permuted block
          randomisation (block size of two) and stratification factors of
          geographical region; macrovascular invasion, extrahepatic spread, or
          both; and baseline alpha-fetoprotein concentration. Primary
          endpoints were confirmed objective response rate in all patients who
          received the combination treatment for group A and progression-free
          survival in the intention-to-treat population in group F, both
          assessed by an independent review facility according to Response
          Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1. In both groups,
          safety was assessed in all patients who received at least one dose
          of any study treatment. This study is registered with
          ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02715531, and is closed to enrolment.
    AB  - FINDINGS: In group A, 104 patients were enrolled between July
          20, 2016, and July 31, 2018, and received atezolizumab plus
          bevacizumab. With a median follow-up of 12.4 months (IQR 8.0-16.2),
          37 (36%; 95% CI 26-46) of 104 patients had a confirmed objective
          response. The most common grade 3-4 treatment-related adverse events
          were hypertension (13 [13%]) and proteinuria (seven [7%]).
          Treatment-related serious adverse events occurred in 25 (24%)
          patients and treatment-related deaths in three (3%) patients
          (abnormal hepatic function, hepatic cirrhosis, and pneumonitis). In
          group F, 119 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned (60 to
          atezolizumab plus bevacizumab; 59 to atezolizumab monotherapy)
          between May 18, 2018, and March 7, 2019. With a median follow-up of
          6.6 months (IQR 5.5-8.5) for the atezolizumab plus bevacizumab group
          and 6.7 months (4.2-8.2) for the atezolizumab monotherapy group,
          median progression-free survival was 5.6 months (95% CI 3.6-7.4)
          versus 3.4 months (1.9-5.2; hazard ratio 0.55; 80% CI 0.40-0.74;
          p=0.011). The most common grade 3-4 treatment-related adverse events
          in group F were hypertension (in three [5%] patients in the
          atezolizumab plus bevacizumab group; none in the atezolizumab
          monotherapy group) and proteinuria (in two [3%] patients in the
          atezolizumab plus bevacizumab group; none in the atezolizumab
          monotherapy group). Treatment-related serious adverse events
          occurred in seven (12%) patients in the atezolizumab plus
          bevacizumab group and two (3%) patients in the atezolizumab
          monotherapy group. There were no treatment-related deaths.
    AB  - INTERPRETATION: Our study shows longer progression-free
          survival with a combination of atezolizumab plus bevacizumab than
          with atezolizumab alone in patients with unresectable hepatocellular
          carcinoma not previously treated with systemic therapy. Therefore,
          atezolizumab plus bevacizumab might become a promising treatment
          option for these patients. This combination is being compared with
          standard-of-care sorafenib in a phase 3 trial.

    AB  - BACKGROUND: Addition of trastuzumab to first-line chemotherapy
          improves overall survival in patients with HER2-positive metastatic
          gastric cancer. We assessed the safety and activity of pembrolizumab
          in combination with trastuzumab and chemotherapy in first-line
          HER2-positive metastatic oesophagogastric (gastric, oesophageal, or
          gastroesophageal junction) cancer.
    AB  - METHODS: This study was an investigator-initiated, open-label,
          non-randomised, single-arm, single centre, phase 2 trial in patients
          aged 18 years or older with HER2-positive metastatic
          oesophagogastric cancer. Eligible patients had measurable or
          evaluable non-measurable disease, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group
          performance status of 0, 1, or 2, and left ventricular ejection
          fraction of at least 53%. Patients were eligible to receive an
          initial induction cycle of 200 mg flat dose of intravenous
          pembrolizumab and 8 mg/kg loading dose of intravenous trastuzumab.
          For subsequent cycles, patients received 130 mg/m2 of intravenous
          oxaliplatin or 80 mg/m2 of cisplatin on day 1, 850 mg/m2 of oral
          capecitabine twice a day for 2 weeks followed by 1 week off (or
          intravenous 5-fluorouracil, 800 mg/m2 per day on days 1-5), and a
          200 mg flat dose of intravenous pembrolizumab, and 6 mg/kg of
          trastuzumab, administered on day 1 of each 3-week cycle. The primary
          endpoint was 6-month progression-free survival, defined as the
          proportion of patients alive and free of progression at 6 months,
          assessed in patients who received at least one dose of trastuzumab
          and pembrolizumab. The regimen would be considered worthy of further
          investigation if 26 or more of 37 patients were progression-free at
          6 months. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov,
          NCT02954536, and is ongoing, but closed to enrolment.
    AB  - FINDINGS: Between Nov 11, 2016, and Jan 23, 2019, 37 patients
          were enrolled. At the time of data cutoff on Aug 6, 2019, median
          follow-up among survivors was 13.0 months (IQR 11.7-23.5). The
          primary endpoint was achieved; 26 (70%; 95% CI 54-83) of 37 patients
          were progression-free at 6 months. The most common treatment-related
          adverse event of any grade was neuropathy, which was reported in 36
          (97%) of 37 patients. The most common grade 3 or 4 adverse events
          were lymphocytopenia (seven [19%] patients with grade 3 and two [5%]
          with grade 4), grade 3 decreased electrolytes (six [16%] patients),
          and grade 3 anaemia (four [11%] patients). Serious adverse events
          occurred in two patients patients (both grade 3 nephritis leading to
          treatment discontinuation). Four patients discontinued pembrolizumab
          because of immune-related adverse events. There were no
          treatment-related deaths.
    AB  - INTERPRETATION: Pembrolizumab can be safely combined with
          trastuzumab and chemotherapy and has promising activity in
          HER2-positive metastatic oesophagogastric cancer. A randomised phase
          3 clinical trial assessing the efficacy and safety of pembrolizumab
          versus placebo in combination with trastuzumab and chemotherapy in
          first-line HER2-positive metastatic oesophagogastric cancer is
          underway.

    AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Over the past 5 years, adjuvant
          treatment options for surgically resected stage III melanoma have
          expanded with the introduction of several novel immune checkpoint
          inhibitors and targeted therapies. Pembrolizumab, a programmed cell
          death protein 1 inhibitor, received US Food and Drug Administration
          approval in 2019 for resected high-risk stage III melanoma based on
          significantly longer recurrence-free survival versus placebo. This
          study evaluated the cost-effectiveness of pembrolizumab versus other
          adjuvant treatment strategies for resected high-risk stage III
          melanoma from a US health system perspective.
    AB  - METHODS: A Markov cohort-level model with four states
          (recurrence-free, locoregional recurrence, distant metastases,
          death) estimated costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) for
          pembrolizumab versus routine observation and other adjuvant
          comparators: ipilimumab in the overall population; and dabrafenib +
          trametinib in the BRAF-mutation positive (BRAF+) subgroup.
          Transition probabilities starting from recurrence-free were
          estimated through parametric multi-state modeling based on phase 3
          KEYNOTE-054 (NCT02362594) trial data for pembrolizumab and
          observation, and network meta-analyses for other comparators.
          Post-recurrence transitions were modeled based on electronic medical
          records data and trials in advanced/metastatic melanoma. Utilities
          were derived using quality-of-life data from KEYNOTE-054 and
          literature. Costs of treatment, adverse events, disease management,
          and terminal care were included.
    AB  - RESULTS: Over a lifetime, pembrolizumab, ipilimumab, and
          observation were associated with QALYs of 9.24, 7.09, and 5.95 and
          total costs of $511,290, $992,721, and $461,422, respectively (2019
          US dollars). Pembrolizumab was thus dominant (less costly, more
          effective) versus ipilimumab, with an incremental cost-effectiveness
          ratio of $15,155/QALY versus observation. In the BRAF+ subgroup,
          pembrolizumab dominated dabrafenib + trametinib and observation,
          decreasing costs by $62,776 and $11,250 and increasing QALYs by 0.93
          and 3.10 versus these comparators, respectively. Results were robust
          in deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses.
    AB  - CONCLUSIONS: As adjuvant treatment for resected stage III
          melanoma, pembrolizumab was found to be dominant and therefore
          cost-effective compared with the active comparators ipilimumab and
          dabrafenib + trametinib. Pembrolizumab increased costs relative to
          observation in the overall population, with sufficient incremental
          benefit to be considered cost-effective based on typical
          willingness-to-pay thresholds.

    AB  - BACKGROUND: Approximately 25% of all patients with
          non-small-cell lung cancer present with resectable stage IB-IIIA
          disease, and although perioperative chemotherapy is the standard of
          care, this treatment strategy provides only modest survival
          benefits. On the basis of the activity of immune checkpoint
          inhibitors in metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer, we designed a
          trial to test the activity of the PD-L1 inhibitor, atezolizumab,
          with carboplatin and nab-paclitaxel given as neoadjuvant treatment
          before surgical resection.
    AB  - METHODS: This open-label, multicentre, single-arm, phase 2
          trial was done at three hospitals in the USA. Eligible patients were
          aged 18 years or older and had resectable American Joint Committee
          on Cancer-defined stage IB-IIIA non-small-cell lung cancer, an
          Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0-1, and a
          history of smoking exposure. Patients received neoadjuvant treatment
          with intravenous atezolizumab (1200 mg) on day 1, nab-paclitaxel
          (100 mg/m2) on days 1, 8, and 15, and carboplatin (area under the
          curve 5; 5 mg/mL per min) on day 1, of each 21-day cycle. Patients
          without disease progression after two cycles proceeded to receive
          two further cycles, which were then followed by surgical resection.
          The primary endpoint was major pathological response, defined as the
          presence of 10% or less residual viable tumour at the time of
          surgery. All analyses were intention to treat. This study is
          registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02716038, and is ongoing but
          no longer recruiting participants.
    AB  - FINDINGS: Between May 26, 2016, and March 1, 2019, we assessed
          39 patients for eligibility, of whom 30 patients were enrolled. 23
          (77%) of these patients had stage IIIA disease. 29 (97%) patients
          were taken into the operating theatre, and 26 (87%) underwent
          successful R0 resection. At the data cutoff (Aug 7, 2019), the
          median follow-up period was 12.9 months (IQR 6.2-22.9). 17 (57%; 95%
          CI 37-75) of 30 patients had a major pathological response. The most
          common treatment-related grade 3-4 adverse events were neutropenia
          (15 [50%] of 30 patients), increased alanine aminotransferase
          concentrations (two [7%] patients), increased aspartate
          aminotransferase concentration (two [7%] patients), and
          thrombocytopenia (two [7%] patients). Serious treatment-related
          adverse events included one (3%) patient with grade 3 febrile
          neutropenia, one (3%) patient with grade 4 hyperglycaemia, and one
          (3%) patient with grade 2 bronchopulmonary haemorrhage. There were
          no treatment-related deaths.
    AB  - INTERPRETATION: Atezolizumab plus carboplatin and
          nab-paclitaxel could be a potential neoadjuvant regimen for
          resectable non-small-cell lung cancer, with a high proportion of
          patients achieving a major pathological response, and manageable
          treatment-related toxic effects, which did not compromise surgical
          resection.

    AB  - BACKGROUND: We did a phase 2 trial of pembrolizumab in
          patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) or melanoma with
          untreated brain metastases to determine the activity of PD-1
          blockade in the CNS. Interim results were previously published, and
          we now report an updated analysis of the full NSCLC cohort.
    AB  - METHODS: This was an open-label, phase 2 study of patients
          from the Yale Cancer Center (CT, USA). Eligible patients were at
          least 18 years of age with stage IV NSCLC with at least one brain
          metastasis 5-20 mm in size, not previously treated or progressing
          after previous radiotherapy, no neurological symptoms or
          corticosteroid requirement, and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group
          performance status less than two. Modified Response Evaluation
          Criteria in Solid Tumors (mRECIST) criteria was used to evaluate CNS
          disease; systemic disease was not required for participation.
          Patients were treated with pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg intravenously
          every 2 weeks. Patients were in two cohorts: cohort 1 was for those
          with PD-L1 expression of at least 1% and cohort 2 was patients with
          PD-L1 less than 1% or unevaluable. The primary endpoint was the
          proportion of patients achieving a brain metastasis response
          (partial response or complete response, according to mRECIST). All
          treated patients were analysed for response and safety endpoints.
          This study is closed to accrual and is registered with
          ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02085070.
    AB  - FINDINGS: Between March 31, 2014, and May 21, 2018, 42
          patients were treated. Median follow-up was 8.3 months (IQR
          4.5-26.2). 11 (29.7% [95% CI 15.9-47.0]) of 37 patients in cohort 1
          had a brain metastasis response. There were no responses in cohort
          2. Grade 3-4 adverse events related to treatment included two
          patients with pneumonitis, and one each with constitutional
          symptoms, colitis, adrenal insufficiency, hyperglycaemia, and
          hypokalaemia. Treatment-related serious adverse events occurred in
          six (14%) of 42 patients and were pneumonitis (n=2), acute kidney
          injury, colitis, hypokalaemia, and adrenal insufficiency (n=1 each).
          There were no treatment-related deaths.
    AB  - INTERPRETATION: Pembrolizumab has activity in brain metastases
          from NSCLC with PD-L1 expression at least 1% and is safe in selected
          patients with untreated brain metastases. Further investigation of
          immunotherapy in patients with CNS disease from NSCLC is warranted.

    AB  - BACKGROUND: Immune checkpoint inhibitors targeting PD-1 have
          shown clinical benefit in adults with cancer, but data on these
          drugs in children are scarce. We did a phase 1-2 study of nivolumab,
          a PD-1 blocking monoclonal antibody, to determine its safety,
          pharmacokinetics, and antitumour activity in children and young
          adults with recurrent or refractory non-CNS solid tumours or
          lymphoma.
    AB  - METHODS: We did a multicentre, open-label, single-arm,
          dose-confirmation and dose-expansion, phase 1-2 trial in 23
          hospitals in the USA. Eligible patients for part A
          (dose-confirmation phase) of the study were aged 1-18 years with
          solid tumours with measurable or evaluable disease (by Response
          Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors [RECIST] version 1.1) regardless
          of histology. Eligible patients for part B (dose-expansion phase)
          were aged 1-30 years with measurable disease (by RECIST criteria) in
          the following disease cohorts: rhabdomyosarcoma, Ewing sarcoma,
          osteosarcoma, neuroblastoma, Hodgkin lymphoma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma,
          and melanoma. Patients in part A and were given nivolumab 3 mg/kg
          intravenously over 60 min on days 1 and 15 of a 28-day cycle in a
          rolling 6 study design with de-escalation upon dose-limiting
          toxicities to establish the recommended phase 2 dose. Patients in
          part B were given the recommended phase 2 dose. The primary outcomes
          were the tolerability, systemic exposure, maximum tolerated dose,
          and the antitumour activity of nivolumab at the adult recommended
          dose in children and young adults. This trial is registered with
          ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02304458, with follow-up ongoing and is
          closed to new participants.
    AB  - FINDINGS: 85 patients were enrolled between Feb 22, 2015, and
          Dec 31, 2018, and 75 patients were fully evaluable for toxicity.
          Median follow-up was 30 days (IQR 27-83). In part A, 13 patients
          were enrolled and 12 were evaluable for toxicity. There were no dose
          de-escalations or dose-limiting toxicities and nivolumab 3 mg/kg was
          confirmed as the paediatric recommended phase 2. 72 patients were
          enrolled in part B and 63 were evaluable for toxicity. Five (7%)
          patients in part B had dose-limiting toxicities. The most common
          overall toxicity was anaemia (35 [47%] of 75 patients; five patients
          had grade 3 or grade 4) and non-haematological toxicity was fatigue
          (28 [37%] patients; none had grade 3 or grade 4). Responses were
          observed in patients with lymphoma (three [30%] of ten with Hodgkin
          lymphoma and one [10%] of ten with non-Hodgkin lymphoma; all
          responders had PD-L1 expression). Objective responses were not
          observed in other tumour types.
    AB  - INTERPRETATION: Nivolumab was safe and well tolerated in
          children and young adults and showed clinical activity in lymphoma.
          Nivolumab showed no significant single-agent activity in the common
          paediatric solid tumours. This study defines the recommended phase 2
          dose and establishes a favourable safety profile for nivolumab in
          children and young adults, which can serve as the basis for its
          potential study in combinatorial regimens for childhood cancer.

    AB  - BACKGROUND: Angiogenesis is critical to gastroesophageal
          adenocarcinoma growth and metastasis. Regorafenib is a multikinase
          inhibitor targeting angiogenic and stromal receptor tyrosine
          kinases. We evaluated whether regorafenib augments the antitumor
          effect of first-line chemotherapy in metastatic esophagogastric
          cancer.
    AB  - MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with previously untreated
          metastatic gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma received 5-fluorouracil,
          leucovorin, and oxaliplatin (mFOLFOX6) every 14 days and regorafenib
          160 mg daily on days 4 to 10 of each 14-day cycle. The primary
          endpoint was 6-month progression-free survival (PFS). To identify
          predictive biomarkers of outcome, we examined correlations between
          genomic characteristics of sequenced pretreatment tumors and PFS.
    AB  - RESULTS: Between August 2013 and November 2014, 36 patients
          with metastatic esophagogastric cancer were accrued to this
          single-center phase II study (NCT01913639). The most common grade
          3-4 treatment-related adverse events were neutropenia (36%),
          leucopenia (11%) and hypertension (8%). The 6-month PFS was 53% (95%
          confidence interval [CI], 38%-71%), the objective response rate was
          54% (95% CI, 37%-70%), and the disease control rate was 77% (95% CI,
          67%-94%). Next-generation sequencing did not identify any genomic
          alterations significantly correlated with response, and there was no
          association between homologous recombination deficiency and PFS with
          platinum-based chemotherapy.
    AB  - CONCLUSION: Regorafenib (one week on-one week off schedule) is
          well tolerated in combination with first-line FOLFOX but does not
          improve 6-month PFS relative to historical control.
    AB  - IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Prognosis for metastatic
          esophagogastric cancer remains poor despite modern systemic therapy
          regimens. This phase II trial indicates that the combination of
          regorafenib and FOLFOX is well tolerated but does not add to the
          efficacy of first-line chemotherapy in metastatic esophagogastric
          cancer. Notably, recently reported data suggest potential synergy
          between regorafenib and the PD-1 inhibitor nivolumab. As this study
          demonstrates that regorafenib plus FOLFOX is safe, and combined
          chemotherapy and immunotherapy show favorable toxicity profiles,
          future studies combining immunotherapy with regorafenib and
          chemotherapy may be feasible. Copyright &#xa9; AlphaMed Press 2019.
