AB  - INTRODUCTION: Anti-EGFR agents are standard treatments for
      patients with EGFR-mutant advanced NSCLC. The feasibility of
      combining erlotinib or gefitinib with the anti-programmed death 1
      immunotherapy pembrolizumab was evaluated in the phase 1/2
      KEYNOTE-021 study (NCT02039674).
AB  - METHODS: Adults with previously untreated stage IIIB/IV
      EGFR-mutant NSCLC were treated with pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg
      intravenously every 3 weeks plus oral erlotinib 150 mg daily in
      cohort E or oral gefitinib 250 mg daily in cohort F, using a 3 + 3
      design with cohort expansion. rTumor response was evaluated per
      Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 by blinded
      independent central review. The primary objective was determination
      of a recommended phase 2 dose.
AB  - RESULTS: Twelve patients enrolled to receive pembrolizumab
      plus erlotinib and seven to receive pembrolizumab plus gefitinib. No
      dose-limiting toxicities or grade 5 events occurred. Pembrolizumab
      plus erlotinib was feasible, with adverse events similar to those
      expected for monotherapy. However, pembrolizumab plus gefitinib was
      not feasible due to grade 3/4 liver toxicity in five of seven
      patients (71.4%), leading to permanent treatment discontinuation in
      four patients. The most frequently occurring treatment-related
      adverse events with pembrolizumab plus erlotinib were rash (50.0%),
      dermatitis acneiform, diarrhea, hypothyroidism, and pruritus (33.3%
      each). The objective response rate was 41.7%, including response in
      all four patients with programmed death ligand 1 expression 50% or
      greater.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Although pembrolizumab plus gefitinib was not
      feasible, the toxicity profile observed with pembrolizumab plus
      erlotinib suggests combining immunotherapy with anti-EGFR therapy is
      feasible. Pembrolizumab plus erlotinib did not improve objective
      response rate compared with previous monotherapy studies; further
      evaluation would be necessary to evaluate potential effects on other
      efficacy outcomes. Copyright &#xa9; 2019 International Association

AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with cancer who are treated with
      monoclonal antibodies are at risk for developing infusion reactions.
      However, for some monoclonal antibodies, the incidence of infusion
      reactions is low or can be lowered by the use of adequate
      premedication schedules. It is often feasible to increase the
      infusion rate/lower the post-administration observation time. This
      review gives an overview of infusion reactions and the possibility
      of accelerating infusion rates.
AB  - MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data on infusion reactions and infusion
      rates for all monoclonal antibodies that are licensed in the
      European Union for treatment of solid tumors or hematological
      malignancies, found by a literature search, were included in this
      review.
AB  - RESULTS: For 11 out of the 21 monoclonal antibodies data
      exceeding the registration text were found and described. Faster
      infusion schedules are possible for bevacizumab, ipilimumab,
      nivolumab, panitimumab, and rituximab.
AB  - CONCLUSION: We propose optimal infusion schedules for each
      drug. Copyright&#xa9; 2020, International Institute of Anticancer

AB  - Introduction: Urothelial carcinoma (UC) has a poor prognosis,
      with the only standard first-line metastatic treatment being
      platinum-based chemotherapy. Until 2018, there was no Food and Drug
      Administration (FDA)-approved drug for second-line setting, and only
      vinflunine was approved by the European Medicines Agency (EMEA) in
      Europe. However, targeting the programmed cell-death 1
      (PD-1)/PD-ligand 1 (PD-L1) pathway with immune checkpoint inhibitor
      (ICI) agents has shown encouraging results. Avelumab is a human
      anti-PD-L1 antibody that is currently being investigated in several
      trials. Areas covered: In this review article, we summarise
      preclinical, clinical, and safety data on avelumab for UC, and
      describeongoing trials that are evaluating avelumab for local or
      advanced diseases. We also compare its place in the management of
      UC. Expert opinion: Avelumab has shown clinical efficacy for
      metastatic and advanced UC in phase I studies after the failure of
      platinum-based therapy with a well-tolerated safety profile. This
      anti-PD-L1 targeting agent has the capacity to induce
      antibody-dependant cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC)-mediated tumor cell
      lysis compared to other ICI. These results led to FDA approval of
      avelumab as a second-line treatment for locally advanced and
      metastatic UC. Avelumab is also investigated in phase II and in a
      randomized phase III trial as a maintenance therapy in UC as well
      for combination use with chemotherapy.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Single-drug checkpoint inhibition has shown
      efficacy in patients with recurrent malignant pleural mesothelioma.
      Here, we assessed the safety and efficacy of the combination of
      nivolumab, an anti-programmed cell death 1 antibody, plus
      ipilimumab, an anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte protein 4 antibody, in
      patients with previously treated and relapsed malignant pleural
      mesothelioma.
AB  - METHODS: INITIATE was a prospective single-centre, single arm,
      phase 2 trial. Patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma who
      progressed after at least one line of platinum-containing
      chemotherapy were enrolled. Key eligibility criteria were measurable
      disease according to the modified Response Evaluation Criteria in
      Solid Tumours for mesotheliomas, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group
      performance status 0 or 1, and adequate organ function. Patients
      received intravenous nivolumab (240 mg every 2 weeks) plus
      intravenous ipilimumab (1 mg/kg every 6 weeks up to four times).
      Treatment was continued for up to 2 years or until confirmed
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. The primary endpoint was
      disease control at 12 weeks. All patients who received at least one
      dose of therapy were included in safety analysis and all patients
      who received one dose of therapy and at least one radiological
      assessment were included in the primary analysis. This trial is
      registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT03048474.
AB  - FINDINGS: Between Oct 5, 2016, and Aug 3, 2017, 38 patients
      were enrolled in the study, of which two patients were excluded
      because they were not eligible for a biopsy. Of 36 eligible
      patients, one deteriorated before the start of the study so was not
      included in any analyses and one withdrew consent after one
      treatment cycle before radiological assessment so was included in
      the safety population only. 34 patients were evaluable for response
      assessment at 12 weeks. Of these, ten (29%) patients had a partial
      response and 13 (38%) patients had stable disease; thus, disease
      control was achieved by 23 (68%, 95% CI 50-83) of 34 patients.
      Treatment-related adverse events were reported in 33 (94%) patients.
      The most common adverse events were infusion-related reactions, skin
      disorders, and fatigue. Grade 3 treatment-related adverse events
      were reported in 12 (34%) of 35 patients.
AB  - INTERPRETATION: In this single-centre phase 2 trial, the
      combination of nivolumab plus ipilimumab showed marked efficacy in
      patients with recurrent malignant pleural mesothelioma. The safety
      profile was consistent with known data on the combination regimen.
      Our results warrant further investigation of this combination in a
      phase 3 trial.

AB  - PURPOSE: Clinical responses with programmed death (PD-1)
      receptor-directed antibodies occur in about 20% of patients with
      advanced head and neck squamous cell cancer (HNSCCa). Viral
      neoantigens, such as the E6/E7 proteins of HPV16/18, are attractive
      targets for therapeutic immunization and offer an immune activation
      strategy that may be complementary to PD-1 inhibition.
AB  - PATIENTS AND METHODS: We report phase Ib/II safety,
      tolerability, and immunogenicity results of immunotherapy with
      MEDI0457 (DNA immunotherapy targeting HPV16/18 E6/E7 with IL12
      encoding plasmids) delivered by electroporation with CELLECTRA
      constant current device. Twenty-two patients with locally advanced,
      p16+ HNSCCa received MEDI0457.
AB  - RESULTS: MEDI0457 was associated with mild injection site
      reactions, but no treatment-related grade 3-5 adverse events (AE)
      were noted. Eighteen of 21 evaluable patients showed elevated
      antigen-specific T-cell activity by IFNgamma ELISpot, and persistent
      cellular responses surpassing 100 spot-forming units (SFUs)/106
      peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were noted out to 1 year.
      Induction of HPV-specific CD8+ T cells was observed. MEDI0457
      shifted the CD8+/FoxP3+ ratio in 4 of 5 post immunotherapy tumor
      samples and increased the number of perforin+ immune infiltrates in
      all 5 patients. One patient developed metastatic disease and was
      treated with anti-PD-1 therapy with a rapid and durable complete
      response. Flow-cytometric analyses revealed induction of
      HPV16-specific PD-1+ CD8+ T cells that were not found prior to
      MEDI0547 (0% vs. 1.8%).
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate that MEDI0457 can generate
      durable HPV16/18 antigen-specific peripheral and tumor immune
      responses. This approach may be used as a complementary strategy to
      PD-1/PD-L1 inhibition in HPV-associated HNSCCa to improve
      therapeutic outcomes. Copyright &#xa9;2018 American Association for

AB  - Importance: Patients with advanced soft tissue sarcoma (STS)
      have a median overall survival of less than 2 years. In a phase 2
      study, an overall survival benefit in this population was observed
      with the addition of olaratumab to doxorubicin over doxorubicin
      alone.
AB  - Objective: To determine the efficacy of doxorubicin plus
      olaratumab in patients with advanced/metastatic STS.
AB  - Design, Setting, and Participants: ANNOUNCE was a
      confirmatory, phase 3, double-blind, randomized trial conducted at
      110 sites in 25 countries from September 2015 to December 2018; the
      final date of follow-up was December 5, 2018. Eligible patients were
      anthracycline-naive adults with unresectable locally advanced or
      metastatic STS, an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance
      status of 0 to 1, and cardiac ejection fraction of 50% or greater.
AB  - Interventions: Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive
      doxorubicin, 75 mg/m2 (day 1), combined with olaratumab (n = 258),
      20 mg/kg in cycle 1 and 15 mg/kg in subsequent cycles, or placebo (n
      = 251) on days 1 and 8 for up to 8 21-day cycles, followed by
      olaratumab/placebo monotherapy.
AB  - Main Outcomes and Measures: Dual primary end points were
      overall survival with doxorubicin plus olaratumab vs doxorubicin
      plus placebo in total STS and leiomyosarcoma (LMS) populations.
AB  - Results: Among the 509 patients randomized (mean age, 56.9
      years; 58.2% women; 46.0% with LMS), all were included in the
      primary analysis and had a median length of follow-up of 31 months.
      No statistically significant difference in overall survival was
      observed between the doxorubicin plus olaratumab group vs the
      doxorubicin plus placebo group in either population (total STS:
      hazard ratio, 1.05 [95% CI, 0.84-1.30], P = .69, median overall
      survival, 20.4 months vs 19.7 months; LMS: hazard ratio, 0.95 [95%
      CI, 0.69-1.31], P = .76, median overall survival, 21.6 months vs
      21.9 months). Adverse events of grade 3 or greater reported in 15%
      or more of total patients with STS were neutropenia (46.3% vs
      49.0%), leukopenia (23.3% vs 23.7%), and febrile neutropenia (17.5%
      vs 16.5%).
AB  - Conclusions and Relevance: In this phase 3 clinical trial of
      patients with advanced STS, treatment with doxorubicin plus
      olaratumab vs doxorubicin plus placebo resulted in no significant
      difference in overall survival. The findings did not confirm the
      overall survival benefit observed in the phase 2 trial.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Immune checkpoint inhibitors are used in the
      treatment of multiple advanced stage cancers but can induce
      immune-mediated colitis necessitating treatment with
      immunosuppressive medications. Diagnostic colonoscopy is often
      performed but requires bowel preparation and may delay diagnosis and
      treatment. Sigmoidoscopy can be performed rapidly without oral bowel
      preparation or sedation.
AB  - AIMS: Characterize the colonic distribution of immune-mediated
      colitis to determine the most efficient endoscopic approach.
AB  - METHODS: A systematic review of checkpoint inhibitor-induced
      colitis case reports and series was conducted in both PubMed and
      Embase through 3 January 2017. A single centre retrospective chart
      review of patients who underwent endoscopic evaluation for diarrhoea
      after treatment with a checkpoint inhibitor (ipilimumab, nivolumab
      or pembrolizumab) between 1 January 2011 and 3 January 2017 was
      performed. Clinical, endoscopic and histologic data were collected.
AB  - RESULTS: A detailed systematic review resulted in 61 studies,
      in which 226 cases of colitis were diagnosed by lower endoscopy (125
      colonoscopy, 101 sigmoidoscopy). Only four patients had isolated
      findings proximal to the left colon. In our centre, 31 patients had
      histologic features of checkpoint inhibitor-induced colitis, for
      which 29 patients had complete data. The left colon was involved in
      all cases. Sigmoidoscopy would be sufficient to diagnose >98% of
      reported cases of checkpoint inhibitor-mediated colitis diagnosed by
      lower endoscopy.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Moderate to severe checkpoint inhibitor-induced
      colitis involves the left colon in the majority of cases (>98%).
      Sigmoidoscopy should be the initial endoscopic procedure in the
      evaluation of this condition. Copyright &#xa9; 2019 John Wiley &

AB  - The multinational phase 3 CheckMate 238 trial compared
      adjuvant therapy with nivolumab versus ipilimumab among patients
      with resected stage III or IV melanoma (N = 906). In this Japanese
      subgroup analysis of CheckMate 238 (n = 28; nivolumab, n = 18;
      ipilimumab, n = 10), both the 12- and 18-month recurrence-free
      survival rates were 56% for nivolumab and 30% for ipilimumab (hazard
      ratio, 0.66; 97.56% confidence interval, 0.19-2.24; P = 0.4390). No
      new safety signals were reported for Japanese patients. Results were
      consistent with those from the CheckMate 238 global population,
      indicating that nivolumab has the potential to be a treatment option
      for Japanese patients with resected melanoma who are at high risk of
      recurrence. Copyright &#xa9; 2019 The Authors. The Journal of

AB  - Pembrolizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody against PD-1
      capable of enhancing antitumor immune activity. The KEYNOTE-001
      study showed that pembrolizumab has activity in advanced
      non-small-cell lung cancer patients and identified programmed death
      ligand 1 (PD-L1) as a companion test to select patients most likely
      to benefit from pembrolizumab. Five randomized clinical trials
      showed the efficacy of pembrolizumab in non-small-cell lung cancer:
      in second-line setting PD-L1 >=1% (KEYNOTE-010), in first-line
      setting PD-L1 >=50% (KEYNOTE-024 and KEYNOTE-042) and in first-line
      setting in combination with platinum doublets, any expression of
      PD-L1 (KEYNOTE-189 and KEYNOTE-407). Future challenges are the
      identification of the role of pembrolizumab in adjuvant,
      neoadjuvant, locally advanced disease or oncogene-addicted patients,
      in combination with radiotherapy or other biological agents.

AB  - We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to fully
      investigate the rash and pruritus of programmed death-1 (PD-1)
      inhibitors in cancer patients. The relevant studies of the
      randomized controlled trials in cancer patients treated with PD-1
      inhibitors were retrieved, and a systematic evaluation was
      conducted. EMBASE, MEDLINE, and PubMed were searched for articles
      published up to April 2018. Nineteen randomized controlled trials
      and 11,006 patients were included. The current meta-analysis
      suggests that the use of PD-1 inhibitors significantly increases the
      risk of developing the all-grade rash (risk ratio [RR] 1.41; 95%CI
      1.14-1.76; P = .002) and pruritus (RR 1.77; 95%CI 1.26-2.49; P =
      .001), and there was no difference between high-grade rash and
      pruritus. The RR of all-grade rash and pruritus did not vary
      significantly according to the type of drug, type of cancer, the
      line of therapy, or the treatment regimen. But both all-grade rash
      and pruritus varied significantly according to control therapy. The
      current meta-analysis suggests that the use of PD-1 inhibitors
      significantly increases the risk of developing all-grade rash and
      pruritus. Physicians should be aware of these adverse events and
      should monitor cancer patients who are receiving PD-1 inhibitors.

AB  - This review summarises the treatment strategies of the last
      five decades for metastatic urothelial cancer. The introduction of
      combination chemotherapy in the mid-1980s led to clinically
      significant response rates and prolonged survival. Two years ago,
      the results of a phase-3 clinical trial with the PD1 inhibitor
      pembrolizumab for second-line treatment of metastatic urothelial
      carcinoma were published. These data were the first to show an
      overall survival benefit in comparison with a conventional
      chemotherapy with vinflunine, docetaxel or paclitaxel. Currently,
      PD1/PD-L1 inhibitors are also tested within randomized
      phase-3-trials for first-line treatment using different approaches
      either as a monotherapy or a combination with conventional
      chemotherapy or CTLA-4 inhibitors. Whereas data from single-arm
      phase-2 clinical trials have already been published, first phase-3
      data are expected in 2019. Copyright &#xa9; Georg Thieme Verlag KG

OA  - Publisher: Dieser Ubersichtsartikel stellt die Ergebnisse
      verschiedener Behandlungskonzepte fur das metastasierte
      Urothelkarzinom in den letzten funf Jahrzehnten zusammen. Mit der
      Einfuhrung von verschiedenen Kombinations-Chemotherapien wurde ab
      Mitte der 80er Jahre eine signifikante Uberlebensverlangerung und
      potenzielle Heilbarkeit auch fortgeschrittener Erkrankungsstadien in
      dieser Tumorentitat postuliert. Vor zwei Jahren wurden Studiendaten
      zur Zweitlinientherapie des metastasierten Urothelkarzinoms mit dem
      PD1-Antikorper Pembrolizumab publiziert, die erstmals einen Vorteil
      im Gesamtuberleben gegenuber einer konventionellen Chemotherapie mit
      Paclitaxel, Docetaxel oder Vinflunin zeigen. Aktuell wird in
      randomisierten Phase-3-Studien der Einsatz von PD-1/PD-L1
      gerichteten Substanzen auch in der Erstlinientherapie des
      metastasierten Urothelkarzinoms untersucht. Dabei werden
      verschiedene Therapiestrategien verfolgt: Monotherapien mit
      PD-1/PD-L1-Inhibitoren sowie deren Kombinationen mit
      CTLA-4-Inhibitoren oder konventioneller Chemotherapie. Es liegen
      bereits Daten aus einarmigen Phase-2-Studien zur Monotherapie vor.
      Erste Daten aus randomisierten Studien werden im Laufe des Jahres
      2019 erwartet.; Language: German

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate patient-reported outcome (PRO) data
      from the IMmotion150 study. The phase 2 IMmotion150 study showed
      improved progression-free survival with atezolizumab plus
      bevacizumab vs sunitinib in patients with programmed death-ligand 1
      (PD-L1)+ tumours and suggested activity of atezolizumab monotherapy
      in previously untreated metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC).
AB  - PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with previously untreated mRCC
      were randomised to atezolizumab 1200 mg intravenously (i.v.) every 3
      weeks (n = 103), the atezolizumab regimen plus bevacizumab 15 mg/kg
      i.v. every 3 weeks (n = 101), or sunitinib 50 mg orally daily (4
      weeks on, 2 weeks off; n = 101). The MD Anderson Symptom Inventory
      (MDASI) and Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI) were administered on days
      1 and 22 of each 6-week cycle. Time to deterioration (TTD), change
      from baseline in MDASI core and RCC symptom severity, interference
      with daily life, and BFI fatigue severity and interference scores
      were reported for all comers. The TTD was the first >=2-point score
      increase over baseline. Absolute effect size >=0.2 suggested a
      clinically important difference with checkpoint inhibitor therapy vs
      sunitinib.
AB  - RESULTS: Completion rates were >90% at baseline and >=80% at
      most visits. Delayed TTD in core and RCC symptoms, symptom
      interference, fatigue, and fatigue-related interference was observed
      with atezolizumab (both alone and in combination) vs sunitinib.
      Improved TTD (hazard ratio [HR], 95% confidence interval [CI]) was
      more pronounced with atezolizumab monotherapy: core symptoms, 0.39
      (0.22-0.71); RCC symptoms, 0.22 (0.12-0.41); and symptom
      interference, 0.36 (0.22-0.58). Change from baseline by visit,
      evaluated by the MDASI, also showed a trend favouring atezolizumab
      monotherapy vs sunitinib. Small sample sizes may have limited the
      ability to draw definitive conclusions.
AB  - CONCLUSION: PROs suggested that atezolizumab alone or with
      bevacizumab maintained daily function compared with sunitinib.
      Notably, symptoms were least severe with atezolizumab alone vs
      sunitinib (IMmotion150; ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01984242).

AB  - The use of the humanized monoclonal anti-programmed cell
      death-1 antibodies pembrolizumab and nivolumab as potent anti-cancer
      therapies is rapidly increasing. However, since their approval
      numerous cases of cutaneous reactions have been reported. Cutaneous
      adverse reactions to these agents have yet to be fully characterized
      and range from non-specific eruptions to recognizable skin
      manifestations, which may be localized and vary from mild to
      life-threatening. This systematic review article provides an
      overview of the various adverse cutaneous reactions to pembrolizumab
      and nivolumab therapy and offers suggestions for their management.

AB  - PURPOSE: Patient-reported outcomes (PRO) were evaluated in the
      phase III IMmotion151 trial (NCT02420821) to inform overall
      treatment/disease burden of atezolizumab plus bevacizumab versus
      sunitinib in patients with previously untreated metastatic renal
      cell carcinoma (mRCC).
AB  - EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive
      atezolizumab 1,200 mg intravenous (i.v.) infusions every 3 weeks
      (q3w) plus bevacizumab 15 mg/kg i.v. q3w or sunitinib 50 mg per day
      orally 4 weeks on/2 weeks off. Patients completed the MD Anderson
      Symptom Inventory (MDASI), National Comprehensive Cancer Network
      Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Kidney Symptom Index
      (FKSI-19), and Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI) at baseline, q3w during
      treatment, at end of treatment, and during survival follow-up.
      Longitudinal and time to deterioration (TTD) analyses for core and
      RCC symptoms and their interference with daily life, treatment
      side-effect bother, and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) were
      evaluated.
AB  - RESULTS: The intent-to-treat population included 454 and 461
      patients in the atezolizumab plus bevacizumab and sunitinib arms,
      respectively. Completion rates for each instrument were 83% to 86%
      at baseline and >= 70% through week 54. Milder symptoms, less
      symptom interference and treatment side-effect bother, and better
      HRQOL at most visits were reported with atezolizumab plus
      bevacizumab versus sunitinib. The TTD HR (95% CI) favored
      atezolizumab plus bevacizumab for core (HR, 0.50; 0.40-0.62) and RCC
      symptoms (HR, 0.45; 0.37-0.55), symptom interference (HR, 0.56;
      0.46-0.68), and HRQOL (HR, 0.68; 0.58-0.81).
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: PROs in IMmotion151 suggest lower overall
      treatment burden with atezolizumab plus bevacizumab compared with
      sunitinib in patients with treatment-naive mRCC and provide further
      evidence for clinical benefit of this regimen. Copyright &#xa9;2020

AB  - Limited data exist on safety and efficacy of immune checkpoint
      inhibitors (ICIs) among organ transplant recipients. The objective
      of this study was to report a case series of two patients with renal
      transplant who received treatment with an ICI and to conduct a
      pooled analysis of published cases to describe the safety and
      efficacy of ICIs in organ transplant patients. A systematic search
      in the Google Scholar and PubMed databases was carried out to
      include all the published cases of organ transplant patients who
      received treatment with ICIs including programmed cell death protein
      1 (PD-1), programmed death-ligand 1, or cytotoxic lymphocyte
      antigen-4 inhibitors since their inscription to January 31, 2019. In
      the present series of two cases with renal allografts who received
      pembrolizumab, one patient with squamous cell carcinoma of the skin
      experienced complete response (CR), whereas another patient with
      melanoma had a mixed response. Both patients experienced allograft
      rejection, but graft was salvaged. The pooled analysis of 64
      patients published in literature showed that overall allograft
      rejection rate is 41% in organ transplant recipients following ICI
      therapy. The graft rejection rate was 44% (17/39) for renal, 39%
      (7/19) for liver, and 20% (1/5) for cardiac allografts. The highest
      risk was seen among patients who were treated with PD-1 inhibitors,
      20/42 (48%)-13/24 (54%) on nivolumab and 7/18 (39%) on
      pembrolizumab. The risk was lowest with ipilimumab, 23% (3/13). The
      overall response rate (CR + partial response [PR]) was 20% with
      ipilimumab, 26% with nivolumab, and 53% with pembrolizumab, whereas
      disease control rate (CR + PR + stable disease) was 35% with
      ipilimumab, 37% with nivolumab, and 53% with pembrolizumab. None of
      the variables including age, gender, type of cancer, type of
      allograft, type of immunosuppression, time since transplantation to
      initiation of ICI, and prior history of rejection were significantly
      associated with the transplant rejection on univariate analysis. The
      efficacy of ICI among patients with organ transplant appears
      promising, warranting testing in prospective clinical trials. The
      risk of rejection and allograft loss is considerable; therefore, the
      risk and alternative form of therapies should be thoroughly
      discussed with the transplant patients prior to initiating ICI
      therapy. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Transplant recipients are at
      higher risk of developing cancers. Although immune checkpoint
      inhibitors have been shown to improve the outcome in more than one
      cancer type, transplant recipients were excluded from these trials.
      Most of the data on the safety and efficacy of immune checkpoint
      inhibitors in transplant patients are based upon case series and
      case reports. The pooled data from these reports suggest that
      anti-programmed death-ligand 1 inhibitors have reasonable safety and
      efficacy among organ transplant patients, which warrants testing in
      clinical trials. Copyright &#xa9; AlphaMed Press 2020.

AB  - AIMS: To evaluate risk of adverse events (AEs) in advanced
      hepatocellular carcinoma (AHCC) with immune checkpoint therapy in
      this setting.
AB  - METHODS: A systematic search of original articles published
      until November 2019 was performed using PubMed, Embase, Web of
      Science, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. And
      a meta-analysis was performed according to the Preferred Reporting
      Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement.
AB  - RESULTS: A total of eight studies, including 597 patients, met
      the eligibility criteria. The median cohort size of patients was 75
      (range: 18-267). The pooled incidence rates of grade>=3 AEs and
      fatal adverse events (FAEs) at last follow-up were 20.87 per 100
      person-years (95% CI: 11.00-39.59, I2=91.0%) and 4.98 per 100
      person-years (95% CI: 1.83-13.56, I2=82.8%). Subgroup analyses
      showed that pembrolizumab had a lower risk of grade>=3 AEs, but a
      higher risk of FAEs, when compared with nivolumab and tremelimumab.
      Meta-regression showed significant correlation between grade>=3 AEs
      rate and proportion of Child-Pugh A stage. Fatigue (16.9%), adrenal
      insufficiency (8.5%) and rash (6.8%) were involved in common
      non-laboratory AEs.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Immune checkpoint therapy significantly increases
      the risk of AEs in AHCC patients. And the risk of grade>=3 AEs is
      associated with Child-Pugh classification. Future retrospective
      analyses and prospective cohort studies are warranted to evaluate
      the safety of immune checkpoint therapy in AHCC. Copyright &#xa9;

AB  - Cemiplimab (Libtayo R) is an antibody immunotherapy that
      stimulates an anti-cancer response via programmed cell death
      protein-1 (PD-1) blockade. It is the first approved treatment in the
      USA and EU for patients with locally advanced (laCSCC) or metastatic
      (mCSCC) cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma who are not candidates for
      curative surgery or curative radiotherapy. Approval was based
      largely on positive results from the phase II EMPOWER-CSCC 1 trial
      in this patient population. In this pivotal trial, treatment with
      intravenous cemiplimab 3 mg/kg once every 2 weeks or 350 mg once
      every 3 weeks resulted in a clinically significant objective
      response rate across laCSCC and mCSCC patient groups. Furthermore,
      responses appear to be durable, as the median duration of response
      has not yet been reached. Similarly, the median overall survival has
      also not yet been reached as of the latest data cut-off date. The
      safety and tolerability profile of cemiplimab was acceptable, with
      most immune-related adverse events being clinically manageable with
      appropriate therapy or discontinuation of cemiplimab. Overall,
      cemiplimab has a durable, clinically significant effect and an
      acceptable tolerability and safety profile. As the first approved
      treatment for this indication, cemiplimab represents a welcome
      therapeutic advance for patients with advanced CSCC.

AB  - Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is typically diagnosed
      at an advanced stage, with systemic therapy being the mainstay of
      treatment. Survival continues to be limited, typically less than 1
      year. The PDAC microenvironment is characterized by a paucity of
      malignant epithelial cells, abundant stroma with predominantly
      immunosuppressive T cells and myelosuppressive-type macrophages
      (M2), and hypovascularity. The current treatment options for
      metastatic PDAC are modified (m)FOLFIRINOX /FOLFIRINOX or
      nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine in patients with good performance
      status (PS) (ECOG 0-1/KPS 70-100%) and gemcitabine with or without a
      second agent for those with ECOG PS 2-3. New therapies are emerging,
      and the current guidelines endorse both germline and somatic testing
      in PDAC to evaluate actionable findings. Important themes related to
      new therapeutic approaches include DNA damage repair strategies,
      immunotherapy, targeting the stroma, and cancer-cell metabolism.
      Targeted therapy alone (outside small genomically defined subsets)
      or in combination with standard cytotoxic therapy, thus far, has
      proven disappointing in PDAC; however, novel therapies are evolving
      with increased integration of genomic profiling along with a better
      understanding of the tumor microenvironment and immunology. A small
      but important sub-group of patients have some of these agents
      available in the clinics for use. Olaparib was recently approved by
      the US Food and Drug Administration for maintenance therapy in
      germline BRCA1/2 mutated PDAC following demonstration of survival
      benefit in a phase 3 trial. Pembrolizumab is approved for patients
      with defects in mismatch repair/microsatellite instability. PDAC
      with wild-type KRAS represents a unique subgroup who have enrichment
      of potentially targetable oncogenic drivers. Small-molecule
      inhibitors including ERBB inhibitors (e.g., afatinib, MCLA-128), TRK
      inhibitors (e.g., larotrectinib, entrectinib), ALK/ROS inhibitor
      (e.g., crizotinib), and BRAF/MEK inhibitors are in development. In a
      small subset of patients with the KRASG12C mutation, a KRASG12C
      inhibitor, AMG510, and other agents are being investigated. Major
      efforts are underway to effectively target the tumor
      microenvironment and to integrate immunotherapy into the treatment
      of PDAC, and although thus far the impact has been modest to
      ineffective, nonetheless, there is optimism that some of the
      challenges will be overcome.

AB  - PURPOSE: Patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC)
      refractory to chemotherapy have limited treatment options.
      Ensituximab (NEO-102) is a novel chimeric monoclonal antibody
      targeting a variant of MUC5AC with specificity to CRC.
AB  - PATIENTS AND METHODS: Single arm, phase II trial assessed the
      efficacy and safety of ensituximab in patients with advanced,
      refractory cancer who expressed MUC5AC antigen in tumor tissue.
      Ensituximab was administered intravenously every 2 weeks with 3
      mg/kg as recommended phase II dose (RP2D). A minimum sample size of
      43 patients was required based on the assumption that ensituximab
      would improve median overall survival by 7 months using a one-sided
      significance level of 10% and 80% power. Written informed consent
      was obtained from all patients.
AB  - RESULTS: Sixty-three patients with advanced, refractory CRC
      were enrolled and 53 subjects were treated in phase 2 arm. Median
      age was 58 years and 46% of the patients were female. Among 57
      evaluable patients, median OS was 6.8 months. No responses were
      observed, and stable disease was achieved in 21% of the patients.
      The most common treatment related adverse events at RP2D included
      fatigue (38%), anemia (30%), nausea (15%), vomiting (11%), increased
      bilirubin (9%), constipation (8%), decreased appetite (6%) and
      diarrhea (6%). Serious adverse events at least possibly related to
      ensituximab occurred in 4 patients and included anemia, nausea,
      increased bilirubin and hypoxia. No patients discontinued treatment
      due to drug related adverse events.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Ensituximab was well tolerated and demonstrated
      modest antitumor activity in patients with heavily pretreated
      refractory CRC. Copyright &#xa9;2020, American Association for
      Cancer Research.

AB  - Combination treatments with immuno-oncology (IO) agents and IO
      agents plus a vascular endothelial growth factor receptor tyrosine
      kinase inhibitor (VEGFR-TKI) have been approved for first-line
      treatment of patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC).
      No direct comparisons have been performed among these treatment
      options. We performed a systematic review and network meta-analysis
      to compare and rank the available regimens for first-line treatment
      in terms of survival benefit and efficacy. In accordance with the
      Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review statement, a
      systematic search of reported studies was performed in MEDLINE, the
      Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and EMBASE up to May
      31, 2019. Network meta-analysis models were adjusted using the
      Bayesian method. Four randomized clinical trials, with a total of
      3758 patients, met the inclusion criteria. Considering systemic
      therapy, 1880 patients had received sunitinib and 550, 432, 442, and
      454 patients had received ipilimumab plus nivolumab (ipi + nivo),
      pembrolizumab plus axitinib (pembro + axi), avelumab plus axitinib
      (avelu + axi), and atezolizumab plus bevacizumab (atezo + bev). No
      difference was found in overall survival between ipi + nivo and
      pembro + axi for the intention to treat population (hazard ratio
      [HR], 1.34; 95% credible interval [CrI], 0.92-1.97). No difference
      was found in progression-free survival among the treatments. The
      overall response rate (ORR) was superior with pembro + axi and avelu
      + axi compared with the ORR with the other treatments (atezo + bev
      vs. pembro + axi: HR, 0.66; 95% CrI, 0.52-0.84; ipi + nivo vs.
      pembro + axi: HR, 0.73; 95% CrI, 0.59-0.90; atezo + bev vs. avelu +
      axi: HR, 0.55; 95% CrI, 0.43-0.71; avelu + axi vs. ipi + nivo: HR,
      1.66; 95% CrI, 1.31-2.12), with no differences across them (HR,
      1.21; 95% CrI, 0.95-1.53). In the present indirect comparison, for
      an intention to treat population, we found no survival differences
      between pembro + axi and ipi + nivo. All treatments showed better
      progression-free survival compared with sunitinib that was similar
      among them. The combination of an IO agent (pembrolizumab or
      avelumab) and axitinib seemed to be the most effective therapy for
      the ORR. Copyright &#xa9; 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Cytotoxic agents have immunomodulatory effects,
      providing rationale for combining atezolizumab (anti-programmed
      death-ligand 1 [PD-L1]) with chemotherapy. The randomized phase III
      IMpower131 study (NCT02367794) evaluated atezolizumab with
      platinum-based chemotherapy in stage IV squamous non-small cell lung
      cancer (NSCLC).
AB  - METHODS: 1021 patients were randomized 1:1:1 to receive
      atezolizumab+carboplatin+paclitaxel (A+CP) (n=338),
      atezolizumab+carboplatin+nab-paclitaxel (A+CnP) (n=343), or
      carboplatin+nab-paclitaxel (CnP) (n=340) for four or six 21-day
      cycles; patients randomized to A+CP or A+CnP received atezolizumab
      maintenance therapy until progressive disease or loss of clinical
      benefit. Coprimary endpoints were investigator-assessed
      progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in the
      intention-to-treat (ITT) population. Secondary endpoints included
      PFS and OS in PD-L1 subgroups and safety. Primary PFS (January 22,
      2018) and final OS (October 3, 2018) for A+CnP vs CnP are reported.
AB  - RESULTS: PFS improvement with A+CnP vs CnP was seen in the ITT
      population (median, 6.3 vs 5.6 months; hazard ratio [HR]=0.71, 95%
      CI: 0.60-0.85; P=0.0001). Median OS in the ITT population was 14.2
      and 13.5 months in the A+CnP and CnP arms, (HR=0.88, 95% CI:
      0.73-1.05; P=0.16), not reaching statistical significance. OS
      improvement with A+CnP vs CnP was observed in the PD-L1-high
      subgroup (HR=0.48, 95% CI: 0.29-0.81), despite not being formally
      tested. Treatment-related grade 3-4 adverse events (AEs) and serious
      AEs occurred in 68.0% and 47.9% (A+CnP) and 57.5% and 28.7% (CnP) of
      patients.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Adding atezolizumab to platinum-based
      chemotherapy significantly improved PFS in patients with first-line
      squamous NSCLC; OS was similar between arms. (Funding: F.

AB  - Interim results from the two-cohort, phase 2 KEYNOTE-100 study
      (NCT02674061) of 376 patients with previously treated advanced
      recurrent ovarian cancer (ROC) showed that pembrolizumab monotherapy
      was associated with an objective response rate (ORR) of 8.0% (95%
      CI, 5.4-11.2). We present outcomes for the Japanese patients (n =
      21) enrolled in KEYNOTE-100. Patients with epithelial ROC had
      received either 1-3 prior chemotherapy lines and had platinum-free
      interval or treatment-free interval (PFI; TFI) of 3-12 months
      (cohort A) or 4-6 prior chemotherapy lines and had PFI/TFI of >=3
      months (cohort B). All patients received pembrolizumab 200 mg every
      3 weeks as monotherapy for 2 years or until progression, death,
      unacceptable toxicity or consent withdrawal. Primary objectives were
      ORR per RECIST v1.1 for each cohort and higher programmed death
      ligand-1 (PD-L1) tumor expression. The relationship between PD-L1
      expression (measured as combined positive score [CPS]) and ORR was
      assessed. Twenty-one Japanese patients (cohort A, n = 19; cohort B,
      n = 2) were treated. The median (range) age was 57 (37-78) years; 19
      (90.5%) patients had ECOG status of 0 and 16 (76.2%) patients had
      stage III-IV disease. ORR was 19.0% (95% CI, 5.4-41.9) and seemed to
      increase with increasing PD-L1 expression. A total of 13 (61.9%)
      patients had treatment-related adverse events (TRAE), and 5 (23.8%)
      had grade 3-4 TRAE. There were no treatment-related deaths in this
      subpopulation. Pembrolizumab monotherapy was associated with
      antitumor activity in Japanese patients with ROC, with no new safety
      signals identified in this subpopulation. The data suggested a trend
      toward higher PD-L1 expression among some patients with higher ORR.

AB  - Introduction: Metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) is a
      challenging disease, whose systemic therapy has traditionally been
      based on a generalized population of patients, with unsatisfactory
      clinical outcomes. Immunotherapy has been shown to be efficacious in
      hypermutated tumors, such as those with microsatellite-instability
      (MSI-H). Nivolumab, and other immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI),
      have recently been evaluated in MSI-H mCRC, with remarkable results.
      Areas covered: Focused on nivolumab, we aim to present the rationale
      for the applicability of ICI in MSI-H CRC, and the results of
      completed phase I/II studies. Ongoing studies, including randomized
      clinical trials, and perspectives of immunotherapy in clinical
      scenarios in CRC will be discussed. Expert opinion: Phase I and II
      clinical trials provide strong evidence for the use of nivolumab and
      other ICI in the systemic therapy of MSI-H mCRC. Regulatory
      approvals are restricted to subsequent lines of therapy, but
      preliminary results in treatment-naive patients are encouraging. The
      findings for advanced disease and in the pilot phase II study in
      early-stage colon cancer open a new avenue for the applicability of
      immunotherapy in neoadjuvant and adjuvant settings, which are
      currently under investigation. With the exception of POLE-mutated
      patients, there is little evidence for the use of immunotherapy in
      MSS patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The open-label, randomized, active-controlled
      KEYNOTE-045 study (NCT02256436) showed that second-line
      pembrolizumab significantly improved overall survival (OS) of
      patients with advanced/metastatic urothelial cancer (UC) that
      progressed after first-line platinum-containing chemotherapy,
      compared with standard chemotherapy (paclitaxel, docetaxel, or
      vinflunine). Pembrolizumab is approved for patients with bladder
      cancer in Japan.
AB  - PATIENTS AND METHODS: Analysis was performed in the subgroup
      of Japanese patients enrolled in the KEYNOTE-045 study. Coprimary
      end points were OS and progression-free survival (PFS). Objective
      response rate (ORR) and safety were secondary end points.
AB  - RESULTS: Fifty-two Japanese patients (pembrolizumab, n = 30;
      chemotherapy, n = 22) were followed up for a median of 26.1 months.
      Patients who received pembrolizumab compared with chemotherapy had a
      19% lower risk for death (hazard ratio [HR] 0.81, 95% CI 0.44-1.50);
      after adjusting for baseline covariates, the HR for OS was 0.61 (95%
      CI 0.32-1.15). The 24-month OS rate was higher with pembrolizumab
      (26.9% vs 14.3%). PFS was 2.0 and 4.9 months for pembrolizumab and
      chemotherapy, respectively (HR 1.71, 95% CI 0.95-3.08). ORR was
      similar for pembrolizumab and chemotherapy (20.0% vs 18.2%);
      durability of response was higher with pembrolizumab: 67% and 33% of
      patients, respectively, maintained a response for > 12 months.
      Treatment-related adverse events, including grade 3-5 events,
      occurred less frequently with pembrolizumab.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Pembrolizumab provided durable antitumor activity
      in patients with locally advanced/metastatic UC that progressed
      after platinum-containing chemotherapy in the overall population and
      in the Japanese subgroup; safety profile was consistent with that
      previously observed for pembrolizumab.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To investigate the efficacy and safety of adding
      anti-epidermal growth factor receptor [EGFR] MoAbs to various
      chemotherapy regimens in patients with RAS wild-type metastasized
      colorectal cancer (RAS WT metastatic colorectal cancer [mCRC]) and
      to identify the optimal combination regimens.
AB  - METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CENTRAL from the
      inception date to 20th May 2019. Randomized clinical trials
      investigating chemotherapy with or without anti-EGFR MoAbs in
      treatment of patients with RAS WT mCRC were included.
AB  - RESULTS: Eighteen studies involving 8848 participants were
      eligible. Comparing with oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy, adding
      anti-EGFR MoAbs benefited only in progression-free survival (PFS)
      (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.80, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.67 to
      0.94), but not in overall survival (OS) (HR = 0.89, 95% CI: 0.78 to
      1.02). Further sensitivity analysis indicated that adding anti-EGFR
      MoAbs to FOLFOLX regimen as a first-line treatment showed benefits
      in both PFS and OS (PFS: HR = 0.74, 95% CI: 0.64 to 0.84; OS: HR =
      0.83, 95% CI: 0.73 to 0.95, respectively). Comparing with
      irinotecan-based chemotherapy or best supportive care, adding
      anti-EGFR MoAbs revealed an improvement in both PFS (HR = 0.77, 95%
      CI: 0.69 to 0.86; HR = 0.46, 95% CI: 0.40 to 0.54, respectively) and
      OS (HR = 0.89, 95% CI: 0.80 to 0.98; HR = 0.65, 95% CI: 0.54 to
      0.78, respectively).
AB  - CONCLUSION: Anti-EGFR MoAbs as a monotherapy or in combination
      with either irinotecan-based chemotherapy or FOLFOX in patients with
      RAS wild-type mCRC have better response and survival outcome,
      whereas OS does not benefit from adding anti-EGFR MoAbs to another
      oxaliplatin-based regimen. Anti-EGFR MoAbs have increased the risk
      of adverse effects than chemotherapy alone. More high-quality
      randomized controlled trials for RAS wild type are necessary.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Various approaches have been developed for the
      treatment of metastatic renal cell carcinoma (MRCC). The objective
      was to assess the efficacy of immunotherapeutic approaches.
AB  - METHODS: We included participants diagnosed with all types of
      histologically confirmed MRCC, the test intervention was
      immunotherapy alone or combined with other immunotherapy or targeted
      therapies, and the study design was restricted to randomized
      controlled trials (RCTs). Primary outcomes were overall survival,
      adverse events, and health-related quality of life. We conducted the
      last search in March 31, 2018.
AB  - RESULTS: We included nine RCTs, and we established seven
      different treatment comparisons according to the type of data. Two
      RCTs favored nivolumab as monotherapy or combined with ipilimumab on
      account of all primary outcomes. The efficacy data of all other
      comparisons were either indifferent or favored the control group.
AB  - CONCLUSION: The immune checkpoint inhibitors nivolumab as
      monotherapy or combined with ipilimumab appears to be the only new
      immunotherapy that may improve overall survival in participants with
      metastatic renal cell carcinoma. Interferon-alpha alone is
      unfavorable to targeted therapies with respect to overall survival
      and adverse events. Copyright &#xa9; 2019 Chinese Cochrane Center,

AB  - BACKGROUND: The IMpower150 trial showed significant
      improvements in progression-free and overall survival with
      atezolizumab plus bevacizumab plus carboplatin plus paclitaxel
      (ABCP) versus the standard-of-care bevacizumab plus carboplatin plus
      paclitaxel (BCP) in chemotherapy-naive patients with non-squamous
      non-small-cell lung cancer. Here, we report the efficacy of ABCP or
      atezolizumab plus carboplatin plus paclitaxel (ACP) versus BCP in
      key patient subgroups.
AB  - METHODS: IMpower150 was a randomised, open-label, phase 3
      study done at 240 academic medical centres and community oncology
      practices across 26 countries worldwide. Patients with
      chemotherapy-naive metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer were
      randomly assigned (1:1:1) to receive ABCP, ACP, or BCP every three
      weeks. The co-primary endpoints were overall survival and
      investigator-assessed progression-free survival in
      intention-to-treat wild-type patients (patients with epidermal
      growth factor receptor [EGFR] or anaplastic lymphoma kinase [ALK]
      genetic alterations were excluded). Efficacy was assessed in key
      subgroups within the intention-to-treat population, including
      patients with EGFR mutations (both sensitising and non-sensitising;
      EGFR-positive) previously treated with one or more tyrosine kinase
      inhibitors and patients with baseline liver metastases. Overall
      survival in the intention-to-treat population was included among
      secondary efficacy endpoints. Exploratory endpoints included the
      proportion of patients achieving an objective response in the
      intention-to-treat population, including EGFR-positive patients and
      patients with baseline liver metastases. Data are reported as per
      the Jan 22, 2018, data cutoff date, at which the number of coprimary
      prespecified overall survival events was met in the ABCP versus BCP
      groups. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number
      NCT02366143, and is ongoing.
AB  - FINDINGS: Between March 31, 2015, and Dec 30, 2016, 1202
      patients were enrolled. 400 patients were randomly assigned to ABCP,
      402 to ACP, and 400 to BCP. In EGFR-positive patients (124 of 1202),
      median overall survival was not estimable (NE; 95% CI 17.0-NE) with
      ABCP (34 of 400) and 18.7 months (95% CI 13.4-NE) with BCP (45 of
      400; hazard ratio [HR] 0.61 [95% CI 0.29-1.28]). Improved overall
      survival with ABCP versus BCP was observed in patients with
      sensitising EGFR mutations (median overall survival NE [95% CI
      NE-NE] with ABCP [26 of 400] vs 17.5 months [95% CI 11.7-NE] with
      BCP [32 of 400]; HR 0.31 [95% CI 0.11-0.83]) and in the
      intention-to-treat population (19.8 months [17.4-24.2] vs 14.9
      months [13.4-17.1]; HR 0.76 [0.63-0.93]). Improved median overall
      survival with ABCP versus BCP was seen in patients with baseline
      liver metastases (13.3 months [11.6-NE] with ABCP [52 of 400] vs 9.4
      months [7.9-11.7] with BCP [57 of 400]; HR 0.52 [0.33-0.82]). Median
      overall survival was 21.4 months (95% CI 13.8-NE) with ACP versus
      18.7 months (95% CI 13.4-NE) with BCP in EGFR-positive patients (HR
      0.93 [95% CI 0.51-1.68]). No overall survival benefit was seen with
      ACP versus BCP in patients with sensitising EGFR mutations (HR 0.90
      [95% CI 0.47-1.74]), in the intention-to-treat population (HR 0.85
      [0.71-1.03]), or in patients with baseline liver metastases (HR 0.87
      [0.57-1.32]). In the intention-to-treat safety-evaluable population,
      grade 3-4 treatment-related events occurred in 223 (57%) patients in
      the ABCP group, in 172 (43%) in the ACP group, and in 191 (49%) in
      the BCP group; 11 (3%) grade 5 adverse events occurred in the ABCP
      group, as did four (1%) in the ACP group, and nine (2%) in the BCP
      group.
AB  - INTERPRETATION: Improved survival was noted for patients
      treated with ABCP compared with those given BCP in the
      intention-to-treat population, and in patients with baseline liver
      metastases. The overall survival signal in the subgroup of patients
      with EGFR sensitising mutations warrants further study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: We conducted a single-arm phase II trial to
      evaluate the efficacy and adverse effects (AEs) of an anti-epidermal
      growth factor receptor monoclonal antibody, nimotuzumab, combined
      with cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil (PF) as first-line treatment in
      recurrent metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma after radical
      radiotherapy.
AB  - METHODS: Patients who met the eligibility criteria were
      recruited from ten institutions (ClinicalTrials.gov; NCT01616849). A
      Simon optimal two-stage design was used to calculate the sample
      size. All patients received weekly nimotuzumab (200 mg) added to
      cisplatin (100 mg/m2 D1) and 5-fluorouracil (4 g/m2 continuous
      infusion D1-4) every 3-weekly for a maximum of six cycles. Primary
      end point was objective response rate (ORR). Secondary end points
      included disease control rate (DCR), progression-free survival
      (PFS), overall survival (OS) and AEs.
AB  - RESULTS: A total of 35 patients were enrolled (13 in stage 1
      and 22 in stage 2). Overall ORR and DCR were 71.4% (25/35) and 85.7%
      (30/35), respectively. Median PFS and OS were 7.0 (95% CI 5.8-8.2)
      months and 16.3 (95% CI 11.4-21.3) months, respectively. Unplanned
      exploratory analyses suggest that patients who received >=2400 mg
      nimotuzumab and >=4 cycles of PF had superior ORR, PFS and OS than
      those who did not (88.9% versus 12.5%, P < 0.001; 7.4 versus 2.7
      months, P = 0.081; 17.0 versus 8.0 months, P = 0.202). Favourable
      subgroups included patients with lung metastasis [HROS 0.324 (95% CI
      0.146-0.717), P = 0.008] and disease-free interval of >12 months
      [HROS 0.307 (95% CI 0.131-0.724), P = 0.004], but no difference was
      observed for metastatic burden. The only major grade 3/4 AE was
      leukopenia (62.9%).
AB  - CONCLUSION: Combination nimotuzumab-PF chemotherapy
      demonstrates potential efficacy, and is well tolerated as first-line
      chemotherapy regimen in recurrent metastatic nasopharyngeal

AB  - Tisagenlecleucel (Kymriah; Novartis Pharmaceuticals) is a
      CD19-directed genetically modified autologous T-cell immunotherapy.
      On August 30, 2017, the FDA approved tisagenlecleucel for treatment
      of patients up to 25 years of age with B-cell precursor acute
      lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) that is refractory in second or later
      relapse. Approval was based on the complete remission (CR) rate,
      durability of CR, and minimal residual disease (MRD) <0.01% in a
      cohort of 63 children and young adults with relapsed or refractory
      ALL treated on a single-arm trial (CCTL019B2202). Treatment
      consisted of fludarabine and cyclophosphamide followed 2 to 14 days
      later by a single dose of tisagenlecleucel. The CR rate was 63% (95%
      confidence interval, 50%-75%), and all CRs had MRD <0.01%. With a
      median follow-up of 4.8 months, the median duration of response was
      not reached. Cytokine release syndrome (79%) and neurologic events
      (65%) were serious toxicities reported in the trial. With
      implementation of a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, the
      benefit-risk profile was considered acceptable for this patient
      population with such resistant ALL. A study of safety with 15 years
      of follow-up is required as a condition of the approval.See related

AB  - BACKGROUND: The programmed cell death-1 (PD-1)/programmed cell
      death ligand-1 (PD-L1) inhibitors have shown encouraging merits in
      non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients, however, they are often
      related to potentially fatal immune-related adverse events (irAEs)
      including colitis. Considering the incidence and characteristics of
      immune-related colitis may have significant implications for the
      appropriate utilization of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors in clinical
      practice, we conduct this meta to systematically analyze the
      correlation between PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors for the treatment of NSCLC
      and the incidence of immune-associated colitis.
AB  - METHODS: Electronic databases including PubMed, Embase,
      Cochrane Library and ClinicalTrials.gov (http://clinicaltrials.gov/)
      were searched up to May 2019, clinical trials reporting all grade
      (1-5), higher grade (3-5) colitis and grade 3-5 diarrhea were
      included, data were expressed as relative risk (RR), incidence,
      corresponding p value and 95% confidence intervals (CIs).
AB  - RESULTS: 9 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were identified
      (7 with PD-1 inhibitors [n=4526]) and 2 with PD-L1 inhibitors
      [n=1464]). The overall incidence of PD-1/PD-L1 target agents was
      1.40% for all grade colitis, 0.89% for severe colitis, 11.62% for
      all grade diarrhea and 1.36% for severe diarrhea. Compared with
      chemotherapy group, the PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors had a significantly
      higher risk of all grade (RR: 3.68, p<0.001) and high-grade (RR:
      2.97, p=0.01) colitis. Additional analysis of relative risk of
      diarrhea revealed that PD-1/PD-L1 treatment moderately reduce the
      risk of all grade diarrhea (RR: 0.64, p=0.03), while the difference
      was not statistically significant in the risk of grade 3-5 diarrhea
      (RR: 0.83, p=0.64). Subgroup analyses showed that the RR of all
      grade and higher grade colitis in PD-1 inhibitors was more
      significant (RR: 3.56, p=0.001 vs RR: 2.98, p=0.02 respectively).
      However, there was no appreciable difference in PD-L1 inhibitors
      (RR: 4.75, p=0.15 vs RR: 2.85, p=0.52 respectively). When compared
      with first-line therapy, second-line therapy associated with a
      higher risk of all grade colitis than first-line therapy (RR: 3.29,
      p=0.006; RR: 4.69, p=0.026).
AB  - CONCLUSION: Our meta-analysis indicates when compared with
      control group, the PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors may lead to a higher risk
      of all grade and high grade immune-mediated colitis, but may result
      in a reduction in all grade diarrhea. PD-1 inhibitors in NSCLC
      patients, but not PD-L1 inhibitors, increase the risk of all- and
      high grade colitis. These results suggest that clinicians shall pay
      more attention to this rare but life-threatening toxic effect.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Whether platelet-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) is a
      prognostic factor for cancer patients treated with immunotherapy is
      under debate. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the relationship
      between PLR and survival of cancer patients treated with immune
      checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs).
AB  - METHODS: A systematical search was performed in databases
      including PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane library to retrieve
      potential eligible clinical studies assessing the prognosis of
      cancer patients with high versus low PLR after immunotherapy, from
      the establishment of the database to June 2019. Quality evaluation
      of included studies was performed, and meta-analyses with regards to
      overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were
      conducted using RevMan 5.3 and STATA 11.
AB  - RESULTS: A total of 12 eligible studies with 1340 cancer
      patients were included. Combined results showed that elevated PLR
      was a negative factor affecting the efficacy of ICIs in cancer
      patients. Patients with high PLR had a significantly shorter OS
      compared to those with low PLR (hazard ratio (HR)=2.02, 95%
      confidence interval (CI): 1.46 to 2.80, P<0.0001), as well as PFS
      (HR=1.74, 95%CI: 1.27 to 2.38, P=0.0006). Similar results were
      observed in sensitivity analyses. Subgroup analyses revealed that
      the prognostic role of PLR on OS and PFS was dependent on cancer
      type, region, and cutoff value. For NSCLC patients, the disease
      stage, ICIs agent, and line of treatment may not influence the
      prognostic role of PLR.
AB  - CONCLUSION: PLR could be a routinely potential prognostic
      factor for ICIs. Low PLR may be associated with better survival for
      cancer patients when treated with immunotherapy. Copyright &#xa9;

AB  - BACKGROUND: The standard treatment for patients with
      unresectable locally advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma
      (ESCC) is definitive chemoradiotherapy (CRT) using 5-FU plus
      cisplatin. However, complete response (CR) rates are low at 11-25%,
      resulting in 9-10 months of median overall survival (OS). An
      improved therapeutic efficacy by combining immunotherapy with
      radiation has been reported in patients with locally advanced
      non-small cell lung cancer. The results using ESCC cell lines
      suggest sequential treatment with anti-PD-L1 agents soon after
      completion of CRT is the most effective combination.
AB  - METHODS: TENERGY trial is a multicenter, phase II,
      proof-of-concept study to assess the efficacy and safety of
      atezolizumab following definitive CRT in patients with locally
      advanced ESCC. The main inclusion criteria are unresectable locally
      advanced ESCC without distant metastasis, completion of 60 Gy of
      radiation plus two concomitant cycles of chemotherapy (cisplatin 70
      mg/m2 on day 1 and 5-FU 700 mg/m2 on days 1-4, every 28 days), and
      adequate organ function. Within 6 weeks after CRT, participants will
      start taking 1200 mg of atezolizumab every three weeks and continue
      until 12 months or disease progression. The primary endpoint is the
      confirmed CR rate by the investigator's assessment. Secondary
      endpoints include overall response rate, progression-free survival
      (PFS), OS, adverse events, and confirmed CR rate by central
      assessment. We will enroll 50 patients (40 with primary locally
      advanced ESCC and 10 with postoperative locoregionally recurrent
      ESCC). We will obtain biopsies from the primary site and will
      collect blood at 3 time points (before CRT, after CRT, and four
      weeks after the start of atezolizumab) for an exploratory biomarker
      study. We will analyze the phenotype of immune-competent cells,
      neoantigens, tumor mutational burden, PD-L1 status, and Human
      Leukocyte Antigen haplotyping.
AB  - DISCUSSION: The synergistic efficacies of the sequential
      combination of CRT and atezolizumab should improve the CR rate,
      resulting in survival improvement for patients with unresectable
      locally advanced ESCC. Because CRT is a standard treatment option
      for patients with early stage to locally advanced ESCC, the
      sequential combination of CRT and atezolizumab has the potential to
      change the standard ESCC treatments.

AB  - BACKGROUND: A number of studies have reported an association
      between the occurrence of immune-related adverse events (irAEs) and
      clinical efficacy in patients undergoing treatment with immune
      checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), but the results remain controversial.
AB  - METHODS: Under the guidance of a predefined protocol and
      Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses
      statement, this meta-analysis included cohort studies investigating
      the association of irAEs and efficacy of ICIs in patients with
      cancer. The primary outcome was overall survival (OS), and the
      secondary outcome was progression-free survival (PFS). Subgroup
      analyses involving the cancer type, class of ICIs, combination
      therapy, sample size, model, landmark analysis, and approach used to
      extract the data were performed. Specific analyses of the type and
      grade of irAEs were also performed.
AB  - RESULTS: This meta-analysis included 30 studies including 4971
      individuals. Patients with cancer who developed irAEs experienced
      both an OS benefit and a PFS benefit from ICI therapy compared to
      patients who did not develop irAEs (OS: hazard ratio (HR), 0.54, 95%
      confidence interval (CI), 0.45-0.65; p < 0.001; PFS: HR, 0.52, 95%
      CI, 0.44-0.61, p < 0.001). Subgroup analyses of the study quality
      characteristics and cancer types recapitulated these findings.
      Specific analyses of endocrine irAEs (OS: HR, 0.52, 95% CI,
      0.44-0.62, p < 0.001), dermatological irAEs (OS: HR, 0.45, 95% CI,
      0.35-0.59, p < 0.001), and low-grade irAEs (OS: HR, 0.57, 95% CI,
      0.43-0.75; p < 0.001) yielded similar results. The association
      between irAE development and a favorable benefit on survival was
      significant in patients with cancer who were undergoing treatment
      with programmed cell death-1 inhibitors (OS: HR, 0.51, 95% CI,
      0.42-0.62; p < 0.001), but not cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen-4
      inhibitors (OS: HR, 0.89, 95% CI, 0.49-1.61; p = 0.706).
      Additionally, the association was significant in patients with
      cancer who were treated with ICIs as a monotherapy (OS: HR, 0.53,
      95% CI, 0.43-0.65; p < 0.001), but not as a combination therapy (OS:
      HR, 0.62, 95% CI, 0.36-1.05; p = 0.073).
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: The occurrence of irAEs was significantly
      associated with a better ICI efficacy in patients with cancer,

AB  - BACKGROUND: Elderly patients represent a major fraction of
      non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients in routine clinical
      practice, but they are still underrepresented in clinical trials. In
      particular, data regarding efficacy and safety in frail or elderly
      patients with respect to immunotherapy are lacking. Importantly,
      immunosenescence in elderly patients might interfere with activities
      of immune-modulating drugs such as PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors. Thus,
      there is an urgent need to assess safety and efficacy of such
      inhibitors in this group.
AB  - METHODS/DESIGN: This prospective, open label, treatment
      stratified, randomized phase II study will enroll 200 patients with
      stage IV NSCLC amenable at least to single-agent chemotherapy (CT).
      Eligible patients must be aged 70 years or older and/or "frail"
      (Charlson Comorbidity Index > 1) or have a restricted performance
      status (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group, ECOG > 1). Patients are
      stratified according to modified Cancer and Age Research Group
      (CARG) score: "fit" patients are allocated to combination CT
      (carboplatin/nab-paclitaxel) and "less fit" patients receive
      single-agent CT (gemcitabine or vinorelbine). After allocation to
      strata, patients are randomized 1:1 to receive either four cycles of
      CT or two cycles of CT followed by two cycles of durvalumab and
      subsequent maintenance treatment with durvalumab every 4 weeks. The
      primary endpoint is the rate of treatment-related grade III/IV
      adverse events (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events
      (CTCAE) V4.03). As secondary endpoints, progression-free survival
      (PFS) according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours
      (RECIST) version 1.1, response rate (RR), overall survival (OS),
      descriptive subgroup analyses according to PD-L1 expression, and
      quality of life are addressed. Geriatric screening assessments and
      functional tests will be performed to complete the phenotyping of a
      potential "frail" and "elderly" patient cohort. The trial is
      accompanied by a biomaterial repository to explore potential
      biomarkers.
AB  - DISCUSSION: The DURATION trial will prospectively investigate
      the safety and tolerability of anti-PD-L1 treatment with durvalumab
      after chemotherapy in elderly and frail patients and thereby provide
      new insights into the effect of PD-L1 blockade and the impact of
      immunosenescence in this cohort of patients.

AB  - Objective: To explore the relations between liver metastases
      (LM) and the efficacy of the treatments with programmed cell death 1
      (PD-1) or programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) inhibitors. Method:
      Pubmed, Embase, American Society of Clinical Oncology and the
      European Society for Medical Oncology were searched to select
      eligible studies about PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitors (Nivolumab,
      Pembrolizumab, Cemiplimab, Avelumab, Durvalumab, and Atezolizumab).
      We included only the original randomized controlled trials (RCTs),
      including the hazard ratios (HR) of death in both patients with LM
      and patients without LM. Then the data were extracted for the
      meta-analysis. Subgroup analyses of cancer types and drug types were
      also performed. Results: 5293 patients [1246 (24%) patients with LM,
      and 4047 (76%) patients without LM] from the eight RCTs were
      included for the final analysis. The pooled hazard ratio (HR) of
      death in the patients with LM was 0.82 (95% CI, 0.71 to 0.93, P =
      .003) while the pooled HR in the patients without LM was 0.72 (95%
      CI, 0.66 to 0.79, P < .001). Additionally, no significant difference
      was found between the two groups (P = .137). Conclusion: No
      statistically significant association of liver metastases with the
      efficacy of treatments with PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitors in the
      treatment of advanced or metastatic cancer was found in the
      stratified analyses. Moreover, future studies about the safety of
      the PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitors in patients with or without liver
      metastases are warranted. Copyright &#xa9; 2020 The Author(s).

AB  - This network meta-analysis (NMA), based on one phase II and
      nine phase III studies, involving 6,124 patients with metastatic
      NSCLC, indirectly compares Atezolizumab + Bevacizumab + chemotherapy
      (ABC), Atezolizumab + chemotherapy (AC), Pembrolizumab +
      chemotherapy (PC), Pembrolizumab alone, Bevacizumab + chemotherapy
      (BC) and chemotherapy alone. Each of these is recommended as
      front-line interventions, according to the US FDA and the European
      Medicines Agency (EMA) for advanced NSCLC without EGFR mutation or
      ALK rearrangement. Studies were identified through PubMed, EMBASE,
      the Cochrane Library, Medline, and abstracts found in oncology
      articles. Primary endpoints, i.e., progression-free survival (PFS)
      and overall survival (OS) with corresponding hazard ratios (HR),
      objective response rates (ORR) and adverse event (AEs) with odds
      risk (OR) were pooled according to frequentist network
      meta-analytical techniques. PD-L1 expression thresholds, as well as
      non-squamous/squamous were used to determine subgroups.
      Immunotherapy plus chemotherapy appeared superior to Pembrolizumab
      alone for PD-L1-high (i.e., TPS>=50%) NSCLC patients. BC might also
      be specifically recommended as an initial first-line treatment for
      PD-L1-high, non-squamous NSCLC patients, since BC was not inferior
      to Pembrolizumab alone. PC and ABC might be preferred for NSCLC
      patients with intermediate PD-L1 (1% <=PD-L1, TPS<50%) expression.
      BC can also be tentatively recommended specifically for
      PD-L1-intermediate, non-squamous NSCLC patients. Combined
      immunotherapies can all be recommended for PD-L1-negative (i.e.,
      TPS<1%) NSCLC patients, although especially the ABC combination for
      non-squamous NSCLC patients, which was superior to PC in regards of
      PFS. However, PC performed comparable to ABC in the whole population
      and in all subgroup save this one. More predictive biomarkers could
      be factored into further analyses to help identifying the most
      effective treatment regimens for specific patient groups. Copyright

AB  - Marginal zone lymphoma (MZL) belongs to the group of indolent
      B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphomas, which is characterized by an
      indolent course. In this mostly elderly patient population, the
      development of chemotherapy-free approaches is of particular
      interest. In this situation, single-agent treatment with the
      next-generation anti-CD20 antibody obinutuzumab is an attractive
      approach, which promises high efficacy without major toxicity. We
      describe here an open-label, multicentric Phase II trial evaluating
      the efficacy and safety of obinutuzumab in de novo MZL patients, who
      are treatment naive for systemic therapy and not eligible for or
      failed local treatment. ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT03322865.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Preclinical and early clinical studies suggest
      that combining epigenetic agents with checkpoint inhibitors can
      potentially improve outcomes in patients with previously treated
      advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). This phase 2 trial
      examined second-line pembrolizumab + CC-486 (oral azacitidine) in
      patients with advanced NSCLC.
AB  - METHODS: Patients with one prior line of platinum-containing
      therapy were randomised in a ratio of 1:1 to CC-486 or placebo, on
      days 1-14, in combination with pembrolizumab on day 1 of a 21-day
      cycle. The primary end-point was progression-free survival (PFS).
      Key secondary end-points included overall survival (OS), overall
      response rate (ORR) and safety.
AB  - RESULTS: Among 100 patients randomised (pembrolizumab +
      CC-486: 51; pembrolizumab + placebo: 49), most were male (57.0%),
      were white (87.0%) and had Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group
      performance status 1 (68.0%). No significant difference in PFS was
      observed between the pembrolizumab + CC-486 and pembrolizumab +
      placebo arms (median, 2.9 and 4.0 months, respectively; hazard ratio
      [HR], 1.374; 90% confidence interval [CI], 0.926-2.038; P = 0.1789).
      Median OS was 11.9 months versus not estimable (HR, 1.375; 90% CI,
      0.830-2.276; P = 0.2968); ORR was 20% versus 14%. Median treatment
      duration was shorter (15.0 versus 24.1 weeks), and the number of
      cycles was lower (5.0 versus 7.0) with pembrolizumab + CC-486 versus
      pembrolizumab + placebo. No new safety signals for CC-486 or
      pembrolizumab were detected. Treatment-emergent adverse events were
      more common in the pembrolizumab + CC-486 arm, particularly
      gastrointestinal, potentially impacting treatment feasibility.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: No improvement in PFS was observed with
      pembrolizumab + CC-486 versus pembrolizumab + placebo. Decreased
      treatment exposure due to adverse events may have impacted efficacy
      with pembrolizumab + CC-486. Copyright &#xa9; 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All

AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with recurrent/metastatic head and neck
      squamous cell carcinoma (R/M HNSCC) progressing on platinum-based
      chemotherapy have poor prognoses and limited therapeutic options.
      Programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) and its ligand 1 (PD-L1) are
      frequently upregulated in HNSCC. The international,
      multi-institutional, single-arm, phase II HAWK study (NCT02207530)
      evaluated durvalumab monotherapy, an anti-PD-L1 monoclonal antibody,
      in PD-L1-high patients with platinum-refractory R/M HNSCC.
AB  - PATIENTS AND METHODS: Immunotherapy-naive patients with
      confirmed PD-L1-high tumour cell expression (defined as patients
      with >=25% of tumour cells expressing PD-L1 [TC >= 25%] using the
      VENTANA PD-L1 [SP263] Assay) received durvalumab 10 mg/kg
      intravenously every 2 weeks for up to 12 months. The primary
      end-point was objective response rate; secondary end-points included
      progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS).
AB  - RESULTS: Among evaluable patients (n = 111), objective
      response rate was 16.2% (95% confidence interval [CI], 9.9-24.4);
      29.4% (95% CI, 15.1-47.5) for human papillomavirus (HPV)-positive
      patients and 10.9% (95% CI, 4.5-21.3) for HPV-negative patients.
      Median PFS and OS for treated patients (n = 112) was 2.1 months (95%
      CI, 1.9-3.7) and 7.1 months (95% CI, 4.9-9.9); PFS and OS at 12
      months were 14.6% (95% CI, 8.5-22.1) and 33.6% (95% CI, 24.8-42.7).
      Treatment-related adverse events were 57.1% (any grade) and 8.0%
      (grade >=3); none led to death. At data cut-off, 24.1% of patients
      remained on treatment or in follow-up.
AB  - CONCLUSION: Durvalumab demonstrated antitumour activity with
      acceptable safety in PD-L1-high patients with R/M HNSCC, supporting
      its ongoing evaluation in phase III trials in first- and second-line
      settings. In an ad hoc analysis, HPV-positive patients had a
      numerically higher response rate and survival than HPV-negative
      patients. Copyright &#xa9; 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier

AB  - BACKGROUND: Atezolizumab (anti-programmed death-ligand 1
      [PD-L1]) received approval from the US Food and Drug Administration
      and European Medicines Agency for previously treated advanced
      non-small-cell lung cancer based on OAK-a randomised, phase III
      trial that showed significantly improved survival with atezolizumab
      versus docetaxel regardless of PD-L1 expression. With longer
      follow-up, we summarised the characteristics of long-term survivors
      (LTSs).
AB  - METHODS: In OAK (NCT02008227), patients were randomised 1:1 to
      receive atezolizumab or docetaxel until loss of clinical benefit or
      disease progression, respectively. Overall survival was evaluated
      after a 26-month minimum follow-up, including in patient subgroups
      defined by best overall response (BOR). LTSs were defined as
      patients who lived >=24 months since randomisation. Non-LTSs died
      within 24 months, and patients censored before 24 months were
      excluded from the analysis. The baseline characteristics, including
      biomarkers, BOR, subsequent non-protocol therapy (NPT) and safety,
      are reported.
AB  - RESULTS: Survival benefit with atezolizumab was observed
      across all patient subgroups defined by BOR. More
      atezolizumab-treated patients were LTSs versus those treated with
      docetaxel (28% versus 18%). Most atezolizumab responders were LTSs
      (77%) versus only 48% of docetaxel responders. However, 21% of
      atezolizumab-arm LTSs had progressive disease (PD) as BOR, and more
      atezolizumab-arm LTSs than non-LTSs continued treatment post-PD.
      Fifty-two percent of docetaxel-arm LTSs received immunotherapy as
      subsequent NPT. Despite extended treatment duration in
      atezolizumab-arm LTSs (median, 18 months), atezolizumab was well
      tolerated.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: After >2 years of follow-up, atezolizumab
      continued to provide durable survival benefit versus docetaxel, with
      tolerable safety. Atezolizumab-arm LTSs were enriched for patients
      with high PD-L1 expression and included PD-L1-negative patients.
      Long-term survival was not limited to responders. Copyright &#xa9;

AB  - PURPOSE: Limited treatment options exist for patients with
      thymic epithelial tumor (TET) whose disease progresses after
      platinum-based chemotherapy. We conducted a phase II study of
      pembrolizumab in patients with TET to evaluate its efficacy and
      safety.
AB  - METHODS: Patients with histologically confirmed TET whose
      disease progressed after at least one line of platinum-based
      chemotherapy were eligible for the study. Patients were excluded if
      they had an active autoimmune disease requiring systemic treatment
      within the past year or documented history of clinically severe
      autoimmune disease. Patients received 200 mg of pembrolizumab
      intravenously every 3 weeks until tumor progression or unacceptable
      toxicity. The primary objective of response rate was assessed every
      9 weeks by investigators.
AB  - RESULTS: Of 33 patients enrolled, 26 had thymic carcinoma and
      seven had thymoma. Of seven thymoma, two (28.6%; 95% CI, 8.2% to
      64.1%) had partial response, and five (71.6%) had stable disease. Of
      26 thymic carcinoma, five (19.2%; 95% CI, 8.5% to 37.9%) had partial
      response and 14 (53.8%) had stable disease. The median
      progression-free survival was 6.1 months for both groups. The most
      common adverse events of any grade included dyspnea (11; 33.3%),
      chest wall pain (10; 30.3%), anorexia (seven; 21.2%), and fatigue
      (seven; 21.2%). Five (71.4%) of seven patients with thymoma and four
      (15.4%) of 26 patients with thymic carcinoma reported grade >= 3
      immune-related adverse events, including hepatitis (four; 12.1%),
      myocarditis (three; 9.1%), myasthenia gravis (two; 6.1%),
      thyroiditis (one; 3.0%), antineutrophil cytoplasmic
      antibody-associated rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis (one;
      3.0%), colitis (one; 3.0%), and subacute myoclonus (one; 3.0%).
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Pembrolizumab showed encouraging antitumor
      activity in patients with advanced TET. Given the high incidence of
      autoimmunity, additional studies are needed to identify those who
      can benefit from pembrolizumab without immune-related adverse
      events.

AB  - In 2019, 12 topics were selected as the major research
      advances in gynecologic oncology. Herein, we first opted to
      introduce the significant clinical activity of pembrolizumab in
      women with advanced cervical cancer based on the results of the
      phase 2 KEYNOTE-158 trial. Thereafter, we reviewed 5 topics,
      including systemic lymphadenectomy in the advanced stage with no
      gross residual tumor, secondary cytoreductive surgery in recurrent
      ovarian cancer according to the results of Gynecologic Oncology
      Group-213 trial, dose-dense weekly paclitaxel scheduling as
      first-line chemotherapy, the utility of intraperitoneal therapy in
      the advanced stage, and an update on poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase
      (PARP) inhibitors for the treatment of ovarian cancer. Additionally,
      we conducted a thorough review of emerging data from several
      clinical trials on PARP inhibitors according to drug, target
      population, and combined usage. For uterine corpus cancer, we
      reviewed adjuvant therapy for high-risk disease and chemotherapy in
      advanced/recurrent disease. For the field of radiation oncology, we
      discussed the utility of neoadjuvant chemotherapy added to
      chemoradiotherapy and the treatment of radiation-induced cystitis
      using hyperbaric oxygen. Finally, we discussed the use of
      individualized therapy with humanized monoclonal antibodies
      (trastuzumab emtansine and sacituzumab govitecan-hziy) and
      combination therapy (fulvestrant plus alpesilib, fulvestrant plus
      anastrozole, and ribociclib plus endocrine therapy) for women with
      advanced breast cancer. Copyright &#xa9; 2020. Asian Society of

AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite several clinical trials and advances in
      understanding the genetic basis of biliary tract cancer (BTC), the
      addition of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) targeted therapy
      does not seem to enhance the activity of first-line chemotherapy
      (CHT).
AB  - MATERIALS AND METHODS: We carried out a meta-analysis of
      available randomized clinical trials to assess the efficacy and
      safety of gemcitabine-based first-line CHT plus monoclonal
      antibodies against EGFR (EGFR-mAbs) in advanced or metastatic BTC.
AB  - RESULTS: In the overall population, the pooled hazard ratio
      for overall (OS) and progression-free (PFS) survival were 0.82 (95%
      confidence interval=0.64-1.06) and 0.88 (95% confidence
      intervaI=0.73-1.08), respectively. No differences were detected in
      objective response rate between the two groups. Patients treated
      with gemcitabine-based CHT plus EGFR-mAbs showed a statistically
      significant increased risk of grade 3-4 neutropenia, grade 3-4
      thrombocytopenia and especially grade 3-4 skin rash.
AB  - CONCLUSION: The addition of EGFR-mAbs to gemcitabine-based
      first-line CHT does not significantly improve overall and
      progression-free survival, nor the objective response rate in
      patients with advanced BTC and increases the risk of hematological
      and cutaneous adverse drug events. Copyright&#xa9; 2020,

AB  - OBJECTIVES: With the introduction of novel immune therapeutics
      for the treatment of disseminated malignancies, we sought to
      evaluate whether deliberate sequencing of immunotherapy before/after
      conventional cytotoxic chemotherapy would have an impact on clinical
      outcomes in patients with previously treated metastatic melanoma. We
      sought to evaluate whether or not ipilimumab immunotherapy
      administered before or after cytotoxic chemotherapy
      (nab-paclitaxel+bevacizumab, AB) would impact clinical outcomes.
AB  - METHODS: We conducted a randomized phase 2 clinical trial of
      patients with BRAF wild-type metastatic melanoma (up to 2 prior
      therapies) who received either: (A) AB followed by ipilimumab
      therapy at progression; or (B) ipilimumab followed by AB treatment
      at progression. The primary goal of the study was a comparison of AB
      versus ipilimumab progression-free survival, with secondary clinical
      and laboratory endpoints.
AB  - RESULTS: This study did not reach full accrual due to
      concurrent Food and Drug Administration approval of anti-programmed
      cell death 1 agents. Nevertheless, the available data suggests a
      cumulative therapeutic advantage to the sequential use of ipilimumab
      followed by AB. Correlative laboratory data revealed a favorable
      effect on systemic immune homeostasis in patients receiving AB
      therapy, of potential interest in further investigations, especially
      in the context of chemotherapy/immunotherapy combinations.
AB  - CONCLUSION: Albeit limited in scope, our data suggest that
      cytotoxic therapy with nab-paclitaxel and bevacizumab appear to
      favorably alter systemic parameters of immune function of potential
      benefit in combination T-cell directed immune checkpoint inhibitor
      therapy.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Angiogenesis is critical to gastroesophageal
      adenocarcinoma growth and metastasis. Regorafenib is a multikinase
      inhibitor targeting angiogenic and stromal receptor tyrosine
      kinases. We evaluated whether regorafenib augments the antitumor
      effect of first-line chemotherapy in metastatic esophagogastric
      cancer.
AB  - MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with previously untreated
      metastatic gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma received 5-fluorouracil,
      leucovorin, and oxaliplatin (mFOLFOX6) every 14 days and regorafenib
      160 mg daily on days 4 to 10 of each 14-day cycle. The primary
      endpoint was 6-month progression-free survival (PFS). To identify
      predictive biomarkers of outcome, we examined correlations between
      genomic characteristics of sequenced pretreatment tumors and PFS.
AB  - RESULTS: Between August 2013 and November 2014, 36 patients
      with metastatic esophagogastric cancer were accrued to this
      single-center phase II study (NCT01913639). The most common grade
      3-4 treatment-related adverse events were neutropenia (36%),
      leucopenia (11%) and hypertension (8%). The 6-month PFS was 53% (95%
      confidence interval [CI], 38%-71%), the objective response rate was
      54% (95% CI, 37%-70%), and the disease control rate was 77% (95% CI,
      67%-94%). Next-generation sequencing did not identify any genomic
      alterations significantly correlated with response, and there was no
      association between homologous recombination deficiency and PFS with
      platinum-based chemotherapy.
AB  - CONCLUSION: Regorafenib (one week on-one week off schedule) is
      well tolerated in combination with first-line FOLFOX but does not
      improve 6-month PFS relative to historical control.
AB  - IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Prognosis for metastatic
      esophagogastric cancer remains poor despite modern systemic therapy
      regimens. This phase II trial indicates that the combination of
      regorafenib and FOLFOX is well tolerated but does not add to the
      efficacy of first-line chemotherapy in metastatic esophagogastric
      cancer. Notably, recently reported data suggest potential synergy
      between regorafenib and the PD-1 inhibitor nivolumab. As this study
      demonstrates that regorafenib plus FOLFOX is safe, and combined
      chemotherapy and immunotherapy show favorable toxicity profiles,
      future studies combining immunotherapy with regorafenib and
      chemotherapy may be feasible. Copyright &#xa9; AlphaMed Press 2019.

AB  - PURPOSE: Despite high tumor mutationburden, immune checkpoint
      blockade has limited efficacy in SCLC. We hypothesized that poly
      (ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibition could render SCLC more
      susceptible to immune checkpoint blockade.
AB  - METHODS: A single-arm, phase II trial (NCT02484404) enrolled
      patients with relapsed SCLC who received durvalumab, 1500 mg every 4
      weeks, and olaparib, 300 mg twice a day. The primary outcome was
      objective response rate. Correlative studies included mandatory
      collection of pretreatment and during-treatment biopsy specimens,
      which were assessed to define SCLC immunephenotypes: desert
      (CD8-positive T-cell prevalence low), excluded (CD8-positive T cells
      in stroma immediately adjacent/within tumor), and inflamed
      (CD8-positive T cells in direct contact with tumor).
AB  - RESULTS: A total of 20 patients were enrolled. Their median
      age was 64 years, and most patients (60%) had
      platinum-resistant/refractory disease. Of 19 evaluable patients, two
      were observed to have partial or complete responses (10.5%),
      including a patient with EGFR-transformed SCLC. Clinical benefit was
      observed in four patients (21.1% [95% confidence interval:
      6.1%-45.6%]) with confirmed responses or prolonged stable disease
      (>=8 months). The most common treatment-related adverse events were
      anemia (80%), lymphopenia (60%), and leukopenia (50%). Nine of 14
      tumors (64%) exhibited an excluded phenotype; 21% and 14% of tumors
      exhibited the inflamed and desert phenotypes, respectively. Tumor
      responses were observed in all instances in which pretreatment
      tumors showed an inflamed phenotype. Of the five tumors without an
      inflamed phenotype at baseline, no during-treatment increase in
      T-cell infiltration or programmed death ligand 1 expression on
      tumor-infiltrating immune cells was observed.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: The study combination did not meet the preset bar
      for efficacy. Pretreatment and during-treatment biopsy specimens
      suggested that tumor immune phenotypes may be relevant for SCLC
      responses to immune checkpoint blockade combinations. The predictive
      value of preexisting CD8-positive T-cell infiltrates observed in
      this study needs to be confirmed in larger cohorts. Copyright

AB  - Atezolizumab (Tecentriq R), an immune checkpoint inhibitor
      against programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1), is the first
      immunotherapy agent to be approved (for use in combination with
      nab-paclitaxel) in the USA, the EU (as first-line) and Japan for the
      treatment of advanced triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). Approval
      was based on the results of the phase III IMpassion130 trial in
      patients with unresectable locally advanced or metastatic TNBC, in
      which atezolizumab plus nab-paclitaxel significantly prolonged
      progression-free survival (PFS) when compared to placebo plus
      nab-paclitaxel in the intent-to-treat (ITT) population and the
      PD-L1+ subgroup. Statistically significant overall survival (OS)
      benefits were not seen in two interim analyses and final OS data are
      awaited. The tolerability and safety profile of atezolizumab plus
      nab-paclitaxel was consistent with those of each individual drug.
      The most common treatment-related adverse events included
      neutropenia, peripheral neuropathy and reduced neutrophil count.
      Adverse events of special interest occurred with higher frequency in
      patients who received atezolizumab plus nab-paclitaxel than placebo
      plus nab-paclitaxel, and were mostly immune-related (e.g.
      immune-related rash, hypothyroidism and hepatitis). Health-related
      quality of life was not significantly impacted by the addition of
      atezolizumab to nab-paclitaxel therapy. Thus, atezolizumab plus
      nab-paclitaxel is a useful immunochemotherapy option for patients
      with unresectable locally advanced or metastatic TNBC, including
      those whose tumours have PD-L1 expression >= 1%.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: There is currently no effective salvage
      therapeutic modality that improves the survival outcomes of patients
      with recurrent or metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma. However, the
      programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) and its ligand (PD-L1)
      inhibitors may provide clinical benefit for these advanced patients.
AB  - MATERIALS AND METHODS: The databases, including PubMed, Web of
      Science, EMBASE and Cochrane Library, were systematically searched
      up to Nov 5, 2019. Data of objective response rate (ORR), disease
      control rate (DCR), progression-free survival (PFS) rate, overall
      survival (OS) rate, and drug-related adverse events were extracted
      and pooled meta-analyzed.
AB  - RESULTS: From 71 search records, eight studies were included
      in the systematic review, of which three were eligible for final
      meta-analysis. In recurrent or metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma
      patients treated with anti-PD-1 therapy, the pooled ORR was 27% (95%
      confidence interval [CI] 19-36%), DCR was 63% (95% CI 50-75%), 6
      months PFS rate was 49% (95% CI 40-58%), 1-year PFS rate was 25%
      (95% CI 19-32%), 1-year OS rate was 61% (95% CI 49-72%). The pooled
      incidences of any grade and grade >= 3 drug-related adverse events
      were 94% and 20% respectively.
AB  - CONCLUSION: We present the aggregate response rates, survival
      rates and incidences of drug-related adverse events for recurrent or
      metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients receiving PD-1/PD-L1
      blockage treatment, which could provide useful information for
      future design of clinical studies. There is a need for more
      randomized controlled studies with head-to-head comparison of
      PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors and traditional chemotherapeutic strategies to
      enable better recommendations for optimal advanced nasopharyngeal
      carcinoma treatment. Copyright &#xa9; 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

AB  - Interim results from the two-cohort, phase 2 KEYNOTE-100 study
      (NCT02674061) of 376 patients with previously treated advanced
      recurrent ovarian cancer (ROC) showed that pembrolizumab monotherapy
      was associated with an objective response rate (ORR) of 8.0% (95%
      CI, 5.4-11.2). We present outcomes for the Japanese patients (n =
      21) enrolled in KEYNOTE-100. Patients with epithelial ROC had
      received either 1-3 prior chemotherapy lines and had platinum-free
      interval or treatment-free interval (PFI; TFI) of 3-12 months
      (cohort A) or 4-6 prior chemotherapy lines and had PFI/TFI of >=3
      months (cohort B). All patients received pembrolizumab 200 mg every
      3 weeks as monotherapy for 2 years or until progression, death,
      unacceptable toxicity or consent withdrawal. Primary objectives were
      ORR per RECIST v1.1 for each cohort and higher programmed death
      ligand-1 (PD-L1) tumor expression. The relationship between PD-L1
      expression (measured as combined positive score [CPS]) and ORR was
      assessed. Twenty-one Japanese patients (cohort A, n = 19; cohort B,
      n = 2) were treated. The median (range) age was 57 (37-78) years; 19
      (90.5%) patients had ECOG status of 0 and 16 (76.2%) patients had
      stage III-IV disease. ORR was 19.0% (95% CI, 5.4-41.9) and seemed to
      increase with increasing PD-L1 expression. A total of 13 (61.9%)
      patients had treatment-related adverse events (TRAE), and 5 (23.8%)
      had grade 3-4 TRAE. There were no treatment-related deaths in this
      subpopulation. Pembrolizumab monotherapy was associated with
      antitumor activity in Japanese patients with ROC, with no new safety
      signals identified in this subpopulation. The data suggested a trend
      toward higher PD-L1 expression among some patients with higher ORR.

AB  - PURPOSE: Gemcitabine and albumin-bound paclitaxel (ABP)
      exhibit synergistic antitumor efficacy, with ABP serving to increase
      the intratumoral gemcitabine concentration. Both drugs are active in
      squamous cell lung cancers (SQCLC) and are conventional partners for
      carboplatin. We hypothesized that combining gemcitabine and ABP
      would enhance the antitumor activity in patients with advanced
      SQCLCs.
AB  - PATIENTS AND METHODS: This was a Simon two-stage, open-label,
      single-arm, multicenter phase II study that enrolled patients
      between August 1, 2015 and June 1, 2018. We enrolled 37 patients
      with chemotherapy-naive, PD-L1 low/unknown advanced stage IV SQCLC.
      Patients were administered weekly intravenous gemcitabine (1,000
      mg/m2) plus ABP (100 mg/m2) in a 3-week on, 1-week off schedule
      during stage I and a 2-week on, 1-week off schedule in stage II. The
      primary endpoint was best objective response rate (ORR).
      Next-generation sequencing by MSK-IMPACT was used to calculate tumor
      mutation burden and genome doubling and assess somatic variants for
      correlations with efficacy.
AB  - RESULTS: Thirty-two patients were evaluable for response
      assessment. The study satisfied its primary endpoint, with confirmed
      partial responses in 18 of 32 patients and a complete response in 1
      patient [ORR 59%; 95% confidence interval (CI), 42%-74%]. Median
      progression-free survival (PFS), a secondary endpoint, was 7.5 (95%
      CI, 6.7-10.5) months. There were no unexpected toxicities.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Gemcitabine plus ABP was a safe, tolerable, and
      effective first-line therapy for patients with chemotherapy-naive
      SQCLCs, with an ORR and median PFS substantially higher than
      carboplatin doublet regimens and efficacy comparable with
      carboplatin plus taxane plus pembrolizumab. Copyright &#xa9;2020

AB  - BACKGROUND: Mismatch repair proficient (MMRp) colorectal
      cancer (CRC) has been refractory to single-agent programmed cell
      death protein 1 (PD1) inhibitor therapy. Colon GVAX is an
      allogeneic, whole-cell, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating
      factor -secreting cellular immunotherapy that induces T-cell
      immunity against tumor-associated antigens and has previously been
      studied in combination with low-dose cyclophosphamide (Cy) to
      inhibit regulatory T cells.
AB  - METHODS: We conducted a single-arm study of GVAX/Cy in
      combination with the PD1 inhibitor pembrolizumab in patients with
      advanced MMRp CRC. Patients received pembrolizumab plus Cy on day 1,
      GVAX on day 2, of a 21-day cycle. The primary endpoint was the
      objective response rate by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid
      Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1. Secondary objectives included safety,
      overall survival, progression-free survival, changes in
      carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels, and immune-related
      correlates.
AB  - RESULTS: Seventeen patients were enrolled. There were no
      objective responses, and the disease control rate was 18% by RECIST
      1.1. The median progression-free survival was 82 days (95%
      confidence interval [CI], 48-97 days) and the median overall
      survival was 213 days (95% CI 179-441 days). Biochemical responses
      (>=30% decline in CEA) were observed in 7/17 (41%) of patients.
      Grade >= 3 treatment-related adverse events were observed in two
      patients (hemolytic anemia and corneal transplant rejection). Paired
      pre- and on-treatment biopsy specimens showed increases in
      programmed death-ligand 1 expression and tumor necrosis in a subset
      of patients.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: GVAX/Cy plus pembrolizumab failed to meet its
      primary objective in MMRp CRC. Biochemical responses were observed
      in a subset of patients and have not previously been observed with
      pembrolizumab monotherapy in MMRp CRC, indicating that GVAX may
      modulate the antitumor immune response. Copyright &#xa9; 2019 The

AB  - BACKGROUND: We sought to ascertain the immune effector
      function of pembrolizumab within the glioblastoma (GBM)
      microenvironment during the therapeutic window.
AB  - METHODS: In an open-label, single-center, single-arm phase II
      "window-of-opportunity" trial in 15 patients with recurrent
      (operable) GBM receiving up to 2 pembrolizumab doses before surgery
      and every 3 weeks afterward until disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicities occurred, immune responses were evaluated
      within the tumor.
AB  - RESULTS: No treatment-related deaths occurred. Overall median
      follow-up time was 50 months. Of 14 patients monitored, 10 had
      progressive disease, 3 had a partial response, and 1 had stable
      disease. Median progression-free survival (PFS) was 4.5 months (95%
      CI: 2.27, 6.83), and the 6-month PFS rate was 40%. Median overall
      survival (OS) was 20 months, with an estimated 1-year OS rate of
      63%. GBM patients' recurrent tumors contained few T cells that
      demonstrated a paucity of immune activation markers, but the tumor
      microenvironment was markedly enriched for CD68+ macrophages.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Immune analyses indicated that pembrolizumab
      anti-programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) monotherapy alone can't induce
      effector immunologic response in most GBM patients, probably owing
      to a scarcity of T cells within the tumor microenvironment and a
      CD68+ macrophage preponderance. Copyright &#xa9; The Author(s) 2019.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related
      deaths worldwide and the prognosis remains poor. The recent
      introduction of the immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI), or plus
      chemotherapy, both resulted in the survival benefit for patients
      with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), but it remains
      unanswered which is superior. The current study aimed to estimate
      the comparative efficacy and safety of ICI-chemotherapy versus
      ICI-monotherapy in advanced NSCLC.
AB  - METHODS: Studies were identified by searching PubMed, Embase,
      and Cochrane library. The randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that
      ICI monotherapy or ICI plus chemotherapy compared with chemotherapy
      in NSCLC were included with available primary endpoints of
      progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), objective
      response rate, or treatment-related adverse events. A fixed-effect
      or random-effects model was adopted depending on between-study
      heterogeneity.
AB  - RESULTS: A total of 20 RCTs involving 12,025 patients with
      NSCLC were included. Both ICI-monotherapy and ICI-chemotherapy
      resulted in significantly prolonged survival compared to
      chemotherapy and the former led to significantly longer PFS. The
      magnitude of survival benefits appeared to be greatest among those
      treated with pembrolizumab plus platinum-based chemotherapy (OS,
      0.56; PFS, 0.54). Additionally, OS and PFS advantages of ICI
      therapies were observed in patients with NSCLC with low or high
      programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression level, but not
      in intermediate PD-L1 TPS.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Pembrolizumab plus platinum-based chemotherapy
      was recommended as the optimal first-line therapy for advanced
      patients with NSCLC. Additionally, PD-L1 alone is not recommended as
      an adequate molecular biomarker to identify eligible patients for
      routine clinical practice in immunotherapy. Copyright &#xa9; 2019

AB  - BACKGROUND: Immune-related pneumonitis is a clinically
      relevant and potentially life-threatening adverse event. We
      performed a systematic review and network meta-analysis to compare
      the risk of immune-related pneumonitis among different PD1/PD-L1
      inhibitor-related therapeutic regimens.
AB  - METHODS: Randomized controlled trials with PD1/PD-L1
      inhibitors were identified through comprehensive searches of
      multiple databases. Both published and unpublished data were
      extracted. Bayesian NMA was performed using random-effects models.
      All-grade (Grade 1-5) and high-grade (Grade 3-5) immune-related
      pneumonitis were estimated using odds ratios (ORs).
AB  - RESULTS: A total of 25 studies involving 16 005 patients were
      included. Compared with chemotherapy, the ORs of immune-related
      all-grade and high-grade pneumonitis were significant for nivolumab
      (all-grade: OR = 6.29, 95% CrI: 2.67-16.75; high-grade: OR = 5.95,
      95% CrI: 2.35-17.29), pembrolizumab (all-grade: OR = 5.78, 95% CrI:
      2.79-13.24; high-grade: OR = 5.33, 95% CrI: 2.49-12.97), and
      nivolumab plus ipilimumab therapy (all-grade: OR = 14.82, 95% CrI:
      5.48-47.97; high-grade: OR = 15.26, 95% CrI: 5.05-55.52). Compared
      with nivolumab, nivolumab plus ipilimumab therapy was associated
      with an increased risk of all-grade pneumonitis (OR = 2.34, 95% CrI:
      1.07-5.77). Nivolumab plus ipilimumab therapy had the highest risk
      of both all-grade and high-grade pneumonitis among PD1/PD-L1
      inhibitor-related therapeutic regimens.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that compared with

AB  - BACKGROUND: Decreased tumor content (TC) in resection
      specimens after neoadjuvant therapy is used to predict prognosis. We
      investigated whether TC assessed in biopsy specimens or the shift in
      TC from baseline to on-treatment can be used accordingly to predict
      response in patients with rare tumors who were treated with
      pembrolizumab.
AB  - METHODS: A total of 57 tumors (represented by 173 baseline and
      179 on-treatment biopsies) from 57 patients with rare tumors
      participating in an ongoing phase II clinical trial of pembrolizumab
      were evaluated. TC was estimated on H&E-stained slides and tumors
      were dichotomized into low and high TC according to a cut-off of
      10%. Necrosis, proliferative fibrosis (PF) and normal tissue were
      assessed in on-treatment biopsies. TC at baseline and on-treatment,
      as well as the shift in TC from baseline to on-treatment, was
      correlated with clinical response defined according to Response
      Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors.
AB  - RESULTS: A decrease in TC was seen in 14% (n=8); no change in
      TC was seen in 75% (n=43); and an increase in TC from baseline to
      on-treatment was seen in 11% (n=6). Objective response was
      significantly associated with decrease in TC from baseline to
      on-treatment (38%, 3/8) compared with no change/increase in TC (6%,
      3/49) (p=0.031). Patients with a decrease in TC had a significantly
      increased time to progression (TTP) (75% probability) compared with
      patients with an increase (20% probability) or no change in TC (19%
      probability) (p=0.0042). Low TC was seen in 23% (13/57) of the
      tumors at baseline and in 26% (15/57) on-treatment. High TC was seen
      in 77% (44/57) of tumors at baseline and in 74% (42/57)
      on-treatment. No significant associations with response were seen
      for necrosis, PF or normal tissue in on-treatment biopsies.
AB  - CONCLUSION: Patients with a decrease in TC from baseline to
      on-treatment had a significant improvement in objective response and
      a longer TTP. Our data suggest that the shift in TC might be used to
      predict response to pembrolizumab in rare tumors. However, further
      investigations in larger cohorts are needed to determine the
      clinical value of TC, the shift in TC and the cut-off of 10%
      assessed in biopsies.

AB  - PURPOSE: Phase III adjuvant trials have reported significant
      benefits in both relapse-free survival (RFS) and overall survival
      (OS) for high-dose interferon alfa (HDI) and ipilimumab at 10 mg/kg
      (ipi10). E1609 evaluated the safety and efficacy of ipilimumab at 3
      mg/kg (ipi3) and ipi10 versus HDI.
AB  - PATIENTS AND METHODS: E1609 was a phase III trial in patients
      with resected cutaneous melanoma (American Joint Committee on Cancer
      7th edition stage IIIB, IIIC, M1a, or M1b). It had 2 coprimary end
      points: OS and RFS. A 2-step hierarchic approach first evaluated
      ipi3 versus HDI followed by ipi10 versus HDI.
AB  - RESULTS: Between May 2011 and August 2014, 1,670 adult
      patients were centrally randomly assigned (1:1:1) to ipi3 (n = 523),
      HDI (n = 636), or ipi10 (n = 511). Treatment-related adverse events
      grade >= 3 occurred in 37% of patients receiving ipi3, 79% receiving
      HDI, and 58% receiving ipi10, with adverse events leading to
      treatment discontinuation in 35%, 20%, and 54%, respectively.
      Comparison of ipi3 versus HDI used an intent-to-treat analysis of
      concurrently randomly assigned patient cases (n = 1,051) and showed
      significant OS difference in favor of ipi3 (hazard ratio [HR], 0.78;
      95.6% repeated CI, 0.61 to 0.99; P = .044; RFS: HR, 0.85; 99.4% CI,
      0.66 to 1.09; P = .065). In the second step, for ipi10 versus HDI (n
      = 989), trends in favor of ipi10 did not achieve statistical
      significance. Salvage patterns after melanoma relapse showed
      significantly higher rates of ipilimumab and
      ipilimumab/anti-programmed death 1 use in the HDI arm versus ipi3
      and ipi10 (P <= .001).
AB  - CONCLUSION: Adjuvant therapy with ipi3 benefits survival
      versus HDI; for the first time to our knowledge in melanoma adjuvant
      therapy, E1609 has demonstrated a significant improvement in OS
      against an active control regimen. The currently approved adjuvant
      ipilimumab dose (ipi10) was more toxic and not superior in efficacy
      to HDI.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Nivolumab showed improvement in overall survival
      (OS) in ATTRACTION-2, the first phase 3 study in patients with
      gastric/gastroesophageal junction (G/GEJ) cancer treated with >= 2
      chemotherapy regimens. The 2-year follow-up results of ATTRACTION-2
      are presented herein.
AB  - METHODS: ATTRACTION-2 was a randomized, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial (49 sites; Japan, South Korea, and
      Taiwan). The median (min-max) follow-up period was 27.3 (24.1-36.3)
      months. The primary endpoint was OS. A subanalysis of OS was
      performed based on best overall response and tumor-programmed death
      ligand-1 (PD-L1) expression status.
AB  - RESULTS: Overall, 493 of 601 screened patients were randomized
      (2:1) to receive nivolumab (330) or placebo (163). OS (median [95%
      confidence interval; CI]) was significantly longer in the nivolumab
      group (5.26 [4.60-6.37] vs 4.14 [3.42-4.86] months in placebo group)
      at the 2-year follow-up (hazard ratio [95% CI], 0.62 [0.51-0.76]; P
      < 0.0001). A higher OS rate was observed in the nivolumab vs placebo
      group at 1 (27.3% vs 11.6%) and 2 years (10.6% vs 3.2%). The OS
      benefit was observed regardless of tumor PD-L1 expression. Among
      patients with a complete or partial response (CR or PR) in the
      nivolumab group, the median OS (95% CI) was 26.6 (21.65-not
      applicable) months; the OS rates at 1 and 2 years were 87.1% and
      61.3%, respectively. No new safety signals were identified.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Nivolumab treatment resulted in clinically
      meaningful long-term improvements in OS in patients with previously
      treated G/GEJ cancer. The long-term survival benefit of nivolumab
      was most evident in patients with a CR or PR.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Systemic cancer therapies may induce infusion
      reactions (IRs) or hypersensitivities. Metastatic colorectal cancer
      (mCRC) patients treated with anti-EGFR therapies, including
      cetuximab and panitumumab, may be subject to these reactions. We
      conducted a meta-analysis to estimate the IR incidence in this
      population and identify variations in this incidence by patient or
      study characteristics.
AB  - METHODS: A systematic review was conducted to identify
      observational studies or clinical trials of mCRC patients treated
      with anti-EGFR therapies that reported occurrences of IRs,
      hypersensitivity, or allergy/anaphylaxis. The objective of the study
      was to estimate the incidence of IRs. Random effects models were
      used to meta-analyze the incidence of IRs overall and stratified by
      therapy type, study design, geographic location, RAS or KRAS
      mutation status, grade of reaction severity, and terminology used to
      describe the reaction.
AB  - RESULTS: The pooled estimate for IR incidence was 4.9% (95%
      confidence interval: 3.6%-6.5%). Lower-grade reactions were more
      common than higher-grade reactions overall and the incidence of
      reactions among cetuximab patients was nearly four times that of
      panitumumab patients (6.1% vs 1.6%).
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: IRs occur in approximately 5% of mCRC patients
      treated with anti-EGFR therapies, and the incidence varies
      significantly by grade of severity and therapy type. Studies
      evaluating these outcomes should consider investigating survival
      outcomes by IR status to determine its prognostic relevance.

AB  - The main aim of this study is to investigate whether baseline
      lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) is associated with the clinical outcome
      of non small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients treated with immune
      checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). We searched Pubmed, the Cochrane
      Central library and Embase for peripheral blood biomarker of LDH in
      advanced NSCLC patients treated with ICIs. We extracted the hazard
      ratio (HR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) for the progression
      free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) and performed
      meta-analysis of HR. Pooled estimates of treatment outcomes were
      calculated by stata 15.1. Six studies with 1136 patients were
      included in this study. The pooled results of univariate analysis
      suggested that an elevated pretreatment LDH level was correlated
      with significant shorter PFS (HR = 1.53, 95% CI 1.27-1.83, P <
      0.001) and OS (HR = 2.11, 95% CI 1.43-3.11, P < 0.001). The
      association remained significant in the multivariate analysis that
      elevated pretreatment LDH level was associated with poor PFS (HR =
      1.62, 95% CI 1.26-2.08, P < 0.001) and OS (HR = 2.38, 95% CI
      1.37-4.12, P = 0.002). A high pretreatment LDH level was
      significantly correlated with shorter PFS and OS. Pretreatment LDH
      may serve as a predictive biomarker for advanced NSCLC patients
      treated with ICIs. Copyright &#xa9; 2019 The Authors. Cancer

AB  - Introduction: Perioperative chemotherapy is the standard
      strategy for localized gastric cancers. Nevertheless, this strategy
      seems to be inefficient, if not deleterious, for patients with
      tumors harboring microsatellite instability (MSI) and/or mismatch
      repair deficiency (dMMR), a tumor phenotype predictive for the
      efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICKi). <br/>Aim(s): The
      GERCOR NEONIPIGA single-arm phase II study (NCT04006262; EUDRACT
      2018-004712-22) aims at evaluating the efficacy of a peri-operative
      strategy with nivolumab and ipilimumab in neoadjuvant setting, then
      nivolumab alone after surgery for patients with resectable MSI/dMMR
      gastric cancer. <br/>Material(s) and Method(s): Main inclusion
      criteria are: gastric and oesogastric junction adenocarcinoma (GOA),
      T2-T4, all N stage and M0, MSI/dMMR. Patients will be treated with
      nivolumab 240 mg Q2 W, 6 infusions, and ipilimumab 1 mg/kg Q6 W, 2
      infusions in neoadjuvant setting. Following surgery, patients with
      TRG 1-2-3 (Mandard tumor regression grade), acceptable tolerance of
      neoadjuvant treatment and postoperative ECOG performance status 0-1,
      will be treated with adjuvant nivolumab 480 mg Q4 W, 9 infusions.
      <br/>Result(s): The primary endpoint is pathological complete
      response rate (pCR-R). Based on a Fleming design, with alpha = 5%
      and beta = 20%, 27 patients have to be evaluated (H0 = 5%; H1 =
      20%). Secondary endpoints include disease-free survival, overall
      survival and safety. <br/>Conclusion(s): This study is planned to
      include 32 patients to evaluate the pCR-R with the combination of
      nivolumab and ipilimumab in neoadjuvant setting for MSI/dMMR
      localized GOA. The MSI/MMR status should be systematically assessed
      on diagnostic biopsies of all GOA. If it meets its primary endpoint,
      the GERCOR NEONIPIGA study might mark a turning point in the
      management of localized MSI/dMMR GOA patients.<br/>Copyright &#xa9;

AB  - BACKGROUND: We sought to ascertain the immune effector
      function of pembrolizumab within the glioblastoma (GBM)
      microenvironment during the therapeutic window. <br/>METHOD(S): In
      an open-label, single-center, single-arm phase II
      "window-of-opportunity" trial in 15 patients with recurrent
      (operable) GBM receiving up to 2 pembrolizumab doses before surgery
      and every 3 weeks afterward until disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicities occurred, immune responses were evaluated
      within the tumor. <br/>RESULT(S): No treatment-related deaths
      occurred. Overall median follow-up time was 50 months. Of 14
      patients monitored, 10 had progressive disease, 3 had a partial
      response, and 1 had stable disease. Median progression-free survival
      (PFS) was 4.5 months (95% CI: 2.27, 6.83), and the 6-month PFS rate
      was 40%. Median overall survival (OS) was 20 months, with an
      estimated 1-year OS rate of 63%. GBM patients' recurrent tumors
      contained few T cells that demonstrated a paucity of immune
      activation markers, but the tumor microenvironment was markedly
      enriched for CD68+ macrophages. <br/>CONCLUSION(S): Immune analyses
      indicated that pembrolizumab anti-programmed cell death 1 (PD-1)
      monotherapy alone can't induce effector immunologic response in most
      GBM patients, probably owing to a scarcity of T cells within the
      tumor microenvironment and a CD68+ macrophage
      preponderance.<br/>Copyright &#xa9; The Author(s) 2019. Published by

AB  - PURPOSE: Gemcitabine and albumin-bound paclitaxel (ABP)
      exhibit synergistic antitumor efficacy, with ABP serving to increase
      the intratumoral gemcitabine concentration. Both drugs are active in
      squamous cell lung cancers (SQCLC) and are conventional partners for
      carboplatin. We hypothesized that combining gemcitabine and ABP
      would enhance the antitumor activity in patients with advanced
      SQCLCs. <br/>PATIENTS AND METHODS: This was a Simon two-stage,
      open-label, single-arm, multicenter phase II study that enrolled
      patients between August 1, 2015 and June 1, 2018. We enrolled 37
      patients with chemotherapy-naive, PD-L1 low/unknown advanced stage
      IV SQCLC. Patients were administered weekly intravenous gemcitabine
      (1,000 mg/m2) plus ABP (100 mg/m2) in a 3-week on, 1-week off
      schedule during stage I and a 2-week on, 1-week off schedule in
      stage II. The primary endpoint was best objective response rate
      (ORR). Next-generation sequencing by MSK-IMPACT was used to
      calculate tumor mutation burden and genome doubling and assess
      somatic variants for correlations with efficacy. <br/>RESULT(S):
      Thirty-two patients were evaluable for response assessment. The
      study satisfied its primary endpoint, with confirmed partial
      responses in 18 of 32 patients and a complete response in 1 patient
      [ORR 59%; 95% confidence interval (CI), 42%-74%]. Median
      progression-free survival (PFS), a secondary endpoint, was 7.5 (95%
      CI, 6.7-10.5) months. There were no unexpected toxicities.
      <br/>CONCLUSION(S): Gemcitabine plus ABP was a safe, tolerable, and
      effective first-line therapy for patients with chemotherapy-naive
      SQCLCs, with an ORR and median PFS substantially higher than
      carboplatin doublet regimens and efficacy comparable with
      carboplatin plus taxane plus pembrolizumab.<br/>Copyright &#xa9;2020

AB  - Background Clinical trials have shown the ability of
      therapeutic vaccines to generate immune responses to
      tumor-associated antigens (TAAs). What is relatively less known is
      if this translates into immune-cell (IC) infiltration into the tumor
      microenvironment. This study examined whether neoadjuvant
      prostate-specific antigen (PSA)-targeted vaccination with PROSTVAC
      could induce T-cell immunity, particularly at the tumor site.
      Methods An open-label, phase II study of neoadjuvant PROSTVAC
      vaccine enrolled 27 patients with localized prostate cancer awaiting
      radical prostatectomy (RP). We evaluated increases in CD4 and CD8
      T-cell infiltrates (RP tissue vs baseline biopsies) using a
      six-color multiplex immunofluorescence Opal method. Antigen-specific
      responses were assessed by intracellular cytokine staining after in
      vitro stimulation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells with
      overlapping 15-mer peptide pools encoding the TAAs PSA, brachyury
      and MUC-1. Results Of 27 vaccinated patients, 26 had matched
      prevaccination (biopsy) and postvaccination (RP) prostate samples
      available for non-compartmentalized analysis (NCA) and
      compartmentalized analysis (CA). Tumor CD4 T-cell infiltrates were
      significantly increased in postvaccination RP specimens compared
      with baseline biopsies by NCA (median 176/mm<sup>2</sup> vs
      152/mm<sup>2</sup> IQR 136-317/mm<inf>2</inf> vs
      69-284/mm<inf>2</inf> p=0.0249; median ratio 1.20; IQR 0.64-2.25).
      By CA, an increase in both CD4 T-cell infiltrates at the tumor
      infiltrative margin (median 198/mm<sup>2</sup> vs 151/mm<sup>2</sup>
      IQR 123-500/mm<sup>2</sup> vs 85-256/mm<sup>2</sup> p=0.042; median
      ratio 1.44; IQR 0.59-4.17) and in CD8 T-cell infiltrates at the
      tumor core (median 140/mm<sup>2</sup> vs 105/mm<sup>2</sup> IQR
      91-175/mm<sup>2</sup> vs 83-163/mm<sup>2</sup> p=0.036; median ratio
      1.25; IQR 0.88-2.09) were noted in postvaccination RP specimens
      compared with baseline biopsies. A total of 13/25 patients (52%)
      developed peripheral T-cell responses to any of the three tested
      TAAs (non-neoantigens); five of these had responses to more than one
      antigen of the three evaluated. Conclusion Neoadjuvant PROSTVAC can
      induce both tumor immune response and peripheral immune response.

AB  - High-dose ipilimumab (IPI) and high-dose interleukin-2 (IL-2)
      are approved agents for metastatic melanoma, but the efficacy and
      safety of the combination are unknown. The objective of this study
      was to evaluate the feasibility, safety, and efficacy of combination
      high-dose IPI and high-dose IL-2 in patients with histologically
      confirmed advanced unresectable stage III and IV melanoma. This
      Phase II, multicenter, open-label, single-arm trial was conducted in
      nine patients enrolled between 12/2014 and 12/2015. Subjects were
      treated with high-dose IPI 10 mg/kg intravenous (IV) every 3 weeks
      for four doses starting at week 1 and high-dose IL-2 (600,000 IU/kg
      IV bolus every 8 h for up to 14 doses) concurrently with IPI at
      weeks 4 and 7. After the first 12 weeks of combination therapy,
      maintenance IPI (10 mg/kg IV) monotherapy was administered every 12
      weeks for up to 1 year. No patient had received prior PD-1 blockade,
      and only one received prior vemurafenib. Confirmed partial response
      was achieved in one (11%), stable disease in four (44%), and
      progressive disease in four (44%) of nine patients. Two patients
      achieved durable disease control of 44+ and 50+ months at the most
      recent follow-up without subsequent therapy. The median overall
      survival was not reached after a minimum 24 months of follow-up
      time. One-year and 2-year survival rates were 89 and 67%,
      respectively. Seven patients (78%) experienced grade 3 or 4 adverse
      events related to the study therapy, three of which were attributed
      to both agents. One patient discontinued the treatment due to liver
      and kidney toxicity. While toxicity was significant, all events were
      reversible, and there was no treatment-related mortality. In
      peripheral blood of patients with decreasing tumor burden, the ratio
      of the non-classical MHC-II proteins HLA-DM to HLA-DO increased
      2-fold, raising the possibility of the ratio of HLA-DM:HLA-DO as a
      novel biomarker of response to treatment. Although the sample size
      was limited, combination therapy with high-dose IPI and high-dose
      IL-2 was feasible and associated with clinical benefit. IL-2-based
      compounds in combination with CTLA-4 blockade should be studied in
      advanced melanoma patients who fail to benefit from first-line PD-1
      blockade. Clinical Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov,

AB  - Background: Pembrolizumab is recommended as first-line therapy
      for patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and a
      Programmed cell death ligand-1 (PD-L1) tumor proportion score (TPS)
      of >=50% without driver mutations. However, the safety and efficacy
      were not investigated among patients who were >=75 years old.
      <br/>Method(s): This open-label single-arm phase II study is
      designed to evaluate pembrolizumab as first-line therapy for
      patients who are >=75 years old with advanced NSCLC and a PD-L1 TPS
      of >=50% without driver mutations. The primary endpoint is
      progression-free survival, and the secondary endpoints are overall
      survival, objective response rate, safety, and quality of life.
      Recruitment started in October 2017 and is expected to continue for
      approximately 3 years. <br/>Conclusion(s): Given the currently poor
      prognosis of elderly patients with advanced NSCLC, we hope that the
      findings of this study will facilitate more effective treatment in
      this setting.<br/>Copyright &#xa9; Journal of Thoracic Disease. All

      most common form of bladder cancer, with high rates of disease
      recurrence and progression. Current treatment for high-risk NMIBC
      involves Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) therapy, but treatment

AB  - There is an unmet need for additional treatments for
      metastatic melanoma, besides anti-PD1 antibodies which are FDA
      approved for adjuvant therapy for stage III or resected stage IV
      melanoma. Talimogene laherparepvec (T-VEC) is the first and only
      FDA-approved oncolytic virus for the treatment of melanoma. New
      viral vectors including coxsackieviruses, HF-10, adenovirus,
      reovirus, echovirus, and newcastle disease virus are currently under
      active development and investigation with varying degrees of
      efficacy in targeting melanoma. The use of T-VEC as a neoadjuvant
      therapy is emerging, but more data is needed at this point. T-VEC
      has also shown promise for use in combination therapy with
      ipilimumab, as T-VEC plus ipilimumab has a significantly higher
      objective response compared to ipilimumab alone. Data comparing
      T-VEC in combination with PD-1 checkpoint inhibitors is awaited, and
      a phase III trial is underway. It is likely that oncolytic viruses
      will have long-term application in the treatment of melanoma and
      that T-VEC in particular will continue to have a role in the
      treatment of patients with readily accessible cutaneous lesions both
      for local control and synergistic induction of antitumor immunity as
      part of combination therapies.<br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2020, Springer

AB  - Background: The immune system plays a decisive role in the
      development of targeted, individualized treatment approaches in
      gynecological oncology. A comparatively high mutational load of
      triple-negative breast cancer compared to other subtypes, as well as
      the resulting immunogenic effect of tumor-associated antigens,
      suggest that immunotherapy could be promising as a targeted
      treatment option for this subtype. <br/>Objective(s): The clinical
      significance of immunotherapeutic approaches in breast cancer was
      investigated. <br/>Material(s) and Method(s): This article gives an
      overview of the mode of action, evidence of clinical effectiveness
      and tolerability of different immunotherapeutic approaches and an
      explanation of the thematic background. <br/>Result(s): Immune
      checkpoint inhibitors (ICPi), which strengthen the tumor-specific T
      cell-mediated immunity by releasing "the body's own brake of the
      immune system", are an important immunotherapeutic treatment option.
      Based on the promising results of a phase III study (IMpassion 130),
      the programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 (PD-L1) antibody atezolizumab
      is already approved as first-line therapy for the treatment of
      metastatic triple-negative breast cancer in combination with
      nab-paclitaxel. Vaccination against tumor-specific neoantigens
      represents another important immunotherapeutic approach, which is
      already being used in clinical studies for the treatment of
      triple-negative breast cancer. <br/>Conclusion(s): There are various
      immunotherapeutic targets based on the cancer immune cell cycle. In
      breast cancer, ICPi and vaccination are of central clinical
      relevance.<br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2020, Springer Medizin Verlag GmbH,

AB  - Background: Hepatic artery infusion (HAI) and drug selection
      by liquid biopsy precision oncotherapy are under investigation for
      the multidisciplinary treatment of unresectable colorectal liver
      metastases (CRCLM) in progression after systemic therapy. Here, we
      compare the safety and efficacy of third-line HAI followed by target
      therapy with drug regimes selected by liquid biopsy precision
      oncotherapy to third-line systemic therapy with drug regimes
      selected partly by tissue biopsy precision oncotherapy, in a
      retrospective real-life study of 106 unresectable CRCLM patients.
      <br/>Method(s): Drug regimens for HAI/target therapy were selected
      by assessing the sensitivity of purified circulating tumor cell
      (CTCs) to 5-fluorouracil, carboplatin, cisplatin, oxaliplatin,
      irinotecan, doxorubicin, mitomycin, raltitrexed, and melphalan
      in-vitro and by real-time qRT-PCR gene expression assays, and for
      the Systemic therapy cohort were selected by age, comorbidity,
      performance status, and absence of RAS mutations. Therapeutic
      responses, adverse events, and quality of life were evaluated by
      RECIST 1.1, CTCAE 4.03, and ECOG criteria, respectively, and
      chemo-filtration performed following HAI to reduce systemic toxic
      effects. <br/>Result(s): HAI/target therapy with drugs selected by
      liquid biopsy precision oncotherapy (44 patients), resulted in 2.27%
      CRs, 38.63% PRs, 56.81% SD,s and 2.27% PDs; ECOG 2 to 1 improvement,
      but no infusion-related technical or vascular complications, or
      deaths. Systemic therapy (62 patients) resulted in 1.6% CRs, 17.74%
      PRs, 37.09% SDs, and 45.16% PDs; more grade 1-2 adverse events and
      4.84% ECOG 1 to 2 worsening. The median 5 month PFS in the
      HAI/target therapy cohort was significantly longer than 3 months in
      the systemic cohort (P < 0.007) and the median 14 month survival in
      the HAI/target therapy cohort was longer than 8.5 months in the
      systemic therapy cohort but not statistically significant.
      Multivariate analysis identified ECOG grade 2 as the most
      unfavourable survival prognostic factor in both cohorts.
      <br/>Conclusion(s): HAI plus chemo-filtration followed by target
      therapy, with drug regimens selected by liquid biopsy precision
      oncotherapy, is a safe and efficacious alternative therapeutic
      strategy for unresectable CRCLM in progression after two lines of
      systemic therapy and should be considered for a multicentre
      prospective phase III study, to fully confirm this
      potential.<br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2020, The Author(s).

AB  - Resectable non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is currently
      considered as a potentially curable disease. Surgery is still the
      main treatment mode for resectable NSCLC, but quite a few patients
      will have local recurrence and distant metastasis after surgery.
      Therefore, preoperative and postoperative adjuvant therapy may be
      necessary in order to improve the long term outcome.
      Immunocheckpoint inhibitor has been demonstrated clinically to be
      effective andapproved as first- or second-line treatment agent in
      metastatic NSCLC or partially locally advanced NSCLC. The remarkable
      efficacy of immunotherapy for advanced lung cancer has attracted
      more and more attention from the researchers to the role of
      immunotherapy as neoadjuvent therapy in resectable non-small cell
      lung cancer. This article systematically reviewed the clinical
      trials of neoadjuvant immunotherapy for resectable NSCLC before
      surgery..

AB  - Background Avelumab, a human anti-programmed death-ligand 1
      immunoglobulin G1 monoclonal antibody, showed favorable efficacy and
      safety in patients with metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma (mMCC) in
      the phase II JAVELIN Merkel 200 trial, leading to approval in
      multiple countries. We describe real-world experience with avelumab
      in patients with mMCC from an expanded access program. Methods
      Eligible patients had mMCC and progressive disease during or after
      chemotherapy or were ineligible for chemotherapy or clinical trial
      participation. Patients received an initial 3-month supply of
      avelumab (administered as 10 mg/kg intravenously every 2 weeks until
      progressive disease or unacceptable toxicity); resupply was allowed
      following complete response, partial response, stable disease, or
      clinical benefit per physician assessment. Results Between December
      15, 2015, and March 4, 2019, 558 of 620 requests from 38 countries
      were medically approved, and 494 patients received avelumab. Among
      240 evaluable patients, the objective response rate was 46.7%
      (complete response in 22.9%, including 3 of 16 potentially
      immunocompromised patients), and the disease control rate was 71.2%.
      The median duration of treatment in evaluable patients with response
      was 7.9 months (range, 1.0-41.7) overall and 5.2 months (range,
      3.0-13.9) in immunocompromised patients. No new safety signals were
      identified. The expanded access program closed for new requests on
      December 31, 2018, as required after regulatory approval;
      benefitting patients continued to receive avelumab. Conclusions The
      avelumab expanded access program for patients with mMCC demonstrated
      efficacy and safety in a real-world setting, consistent with the
      results from JAVELIN Merkel 200, and provided a treatment for
      patients with limited options.<br/>Copyright &#xa9; Author(s) (or

AB  - Aims: To evaluate risk of adverse events (AEs) in advanced
      hepatocellular carcinoma (AHCC) with immune checkpoint therapy in
      this setting. <br/>Method(s): A systematic search of original
      articles published until November 2019 was performed using PubMed,
      Embase, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Central Register of
      Controlled Trials. And a meta-analysis was performed according to
      the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and
      Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement. <br/>Result(s): A total of eight
      studies, including 597 patients, met the eligibility criteria. The
      median cohort size of patients was 75 (range: 18-267). The pooled
      incidence rates of grade >= 3 AEs and fatal adverse events (FAEs) at
      last follow-up were 20.87 per 100 person-years (95% CI: 11.00-39.59,
      I<sup>2</sup> = 91.0%) and 4.98 per 100 person-years (95% CI:
      1.83-13.56, I<sup>2</sup> = 82.8%). Subgroup analyses showed that
      pembrolizumab had a lower risk of grade >= 3 AEs, but a higher risk
      of FAEs, when compared with nivolumab and tremelimumab.
      Meta-regression showed significant correlation between grade >= 3
      AEs rate and proportion of Child-Pugh A stage. Fatigue (16.9%),
      adrenal insufficiency (8.5%) and rash (6.8%) were involved in common
      non-laboratory AEs. <br/>Conclusion(s): Immune checkpoint therapy
      significantly increases the risk of AEs in AHCC patients. And the
      risk of grade >= 3 AEs is associated with Child-Pugh classification.
      Future retrospective analyses and prospective cohort studies are
      warranted to evaluate the safety of immune checkpoint therapy in
      AHCC.<br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2020

AB  - BACKGROUND: The phase 3 RANGE trial found
      ramucirumab/docetaxel improved progression-free survival (PFS)
      versus placebo/docetaxel (median 4.1 vs 2.8 months; hazard ratio
      [HR]=0.757, p=0.0118) for treatment of platinum-refractory
      metastatic urothelial carcinoma (UC). Some patients received an
      immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) prior to RANGE. In other studies,
      unselected patients with platinum-refractory UC exhibited an overall
      response rate (ORR) of 15-31% to ICIs. <br/>OBJECTIVE(S): Efficacy
      and safety data from the subgroup of patients treated with prior ICI
      were examined using prespecified analyses to compare outcomes
      between RANGE treatment arms. <br/>METHOD(S): Randomized,
      double-blind RANGE study (n=530) took place July 2015-April 2017 in
      23 countries. Forty-five patients (8.5%) received prior ICI. PFS was
      evaluated using the Kaplan-Meier method and unstratified Cox
      proportional hazards model. <br/>RESULT(S): 17 ramucirumab/docetaxel
      arm, 28 placebo/docetaxel arm patients were treated with an ICI. The
      prior-ICI ramucirumab subgroup had worse Bellmunt scores at baseline
      versus placebo (score of 2-3:70.6% vs 25%, respectively). Most
      patients (84.4%) received the ICI immediately following platinum and
      immediately prior to RANGE. ORR to prior ICI was 6.7% Responses were
      achieved by 5/17 (29.4%) on ramucirumab/docetaxel, compared to 2/28
      (7.1%) on placebo/docetaxel. Median PFS was 3.15 months on
      ramucirumab/docetaxel versus 2.73 months on placebo/docetaxel
      (HR=0.786, 95% CI=0.404-1.528, p=0.4877). The frequency of grade>=3
      adverse events was similar between arms. Limitations include sample
      size and treatment setting of the analyzed population.
      <br/>CONCLUSION(S): Ramucirumab/docetaxel may provide a clinical
      benefit with acceptable safety in the third-line setting for
      metastatic UC patients whose disease has progressed on both prior
      platinum chemotherapy and ICI therapy.<br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2020 -

AB  - Background Adoptive cell therapy (ACT) with tumor-reactive T
      cells has shown consistent clinical efficacy. We evaluated the
      response to ACT in combination with interferon alpha (IFNa)
      preconditioning in patients with stage IV metastatic melanoma, most
      of which were progressive on cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated
      protein 4 and/or programmed cell death protein 1 checkpoint blockade
      therapy. Methods Thirty-four patients were treated with ex vivo
      expanded tumor reactive T cells, derived from mixed lymphocyte
      autologous tumor cultures, or with autologous tumor-infiltrating
      lymphocytes and evaluated for clinical response. Clinical and
      immunological parameters associated with response were also
      evaluated. Results Best overall response defined as clinical
      benefit, comprising either complete response, partial response or
      stable disease >6 months, was observed in 29% of the patients.
      Forty-three per cent of the 14 immunotherapy-naive patients and 20%
      of the 20 patients progressive on prior immunotherapy benefited from
      ACT. The overall survival (OS) was 90% versus 28.6% at 1 year and
      46.7% versus 0% at 3 years follow-up, of responder and non-responder
      patients, respectively. Median OS was 36 versus 7 months,
      respectively. IFNa pretreatment resulted in leukopenia, neutropenia
      and lymphopenia, which was sustained during the treatment in
      clinical responders and associated with response. Differences in
      antigen specificity, but not in phenotype, cytokine profile or CD8+
      T cell number of the ACT products correlated with clinical response.
      Cross-reactivity of the ACT products to one or more allogeneic human
      leukocyte antigen-matched melanoma cell lines was associated with
      short OS after treatment while the ACT products of very long-term
      survivors showed no cross-reactivity but recognized patient-specific
      neoantigens. Conclusion This study demonstrates that ACT in
      combination with a mild IFNa preconditioning regimen can induce
      clinical benefit even in immunotherapy pretreated patients, although
      with lower success than in immunotherapy-naive patients. ACT
      products comprising neoantigen reactivity may be more
      effective.<br/>Copyright &#xa9; Author(s) (or their employer(s))

AB  - Introduction: So far, anti-PD-1/anti-PD-L1 antibody therapy is
      reportedly in treating gastric cancer or gastro-oesophageal junction
      cancer (GC/GEJC) in a number of clinical trials. Based on this, we
      conducted current meta-analysis to assess the safety and efficacy of
      anti-PD-1/anti-PD-L1 antibody for previously treated advanced
      GC/GEJC patients. <br/>Method(s): We searched five electronic
      databases for eligible records. Outcomes were presented and analyzed
      by objective response rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR),
      progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS) and adverse
      effects (AEs). <br/>Result(s): Nine records involving 1388
      participants were selected in our study. The pooled ORR, DCR, OS
      rate (6 month), PFS rate (6 month), OS rate (12 month) and PFS rate
      (12 month) were 10% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 6%-14%), 32%
      (95%CI: 25%-38%), 52% (95%CI: 44%-61%), 18% (95%CI: 13%-24%), 40%
      (95%CI: 31%-48%) and 8% (95%CI: 5%-10%), respectively. Meanwhile,
      grade >= 3 AEs rate was 12% (95% CI: 10%-15%). Programmed death
      ligand 1 (PD-L1) positive cases had higher rate of ORR (odds ratio
      [OR]: 3.75, 95%CI: 2.09-6.74, P = 0.58) compared with negative
      cases. <br/>Conclusion(s): The results indicated that
      anti-PD-1/anti-PD-L1 antibody therapy has an effectual anti-tumor
      activity and controllable AEs in advanced GC/GEJC patients.
      Furthermore, overexpression of PD-L1 in advanced GC/GEJC patients
      had better ORR from anti-PD-1/anti-PD-L1 antibody therapy (PROSPERO

AB  - Background: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a major cause of
      cancer-related death. It is a highly vascular tumour with multiple
      angiogenic factors, most importantly vascular endothelial growth
      factor (VEGF), involved in HCC progression. Tivozanib is an oral
      inhibitor of VEGFR-1/2/3 with promising activity against HCC in
      vivo. <br/>Method(s): We conducted a phase 1b/2 study of tivozanib
      in patients with advanced HCC. The safety, dosing, pharmacokinetics,
      pharmacodynamics, and preliminary antineoplastic efficacy of
      tivozanib were evaluated. <br/>Result(s): Twenty-seven patients
      received at least one dose of tivozanib. Using a 3+3 design, the
      recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of tivozanib was determined to be 1
      mg per os once daily, 21 days on-7 days off. The median
      progression-free and overall survival were 24 weeks and 9 months,
      respectively, for patients treated at RP2D. The overall response
      rate was 21%. Treatment was well tolerated. A significant decrease
      in soluble plasma VEGFR-2 was noted, assuring adequate target
      engagement. <br/>Conclusion(s): Although this study did not proceed
      to stage 2, there was an early efficacy signal with a very
      favourable toxicity profile. A phase 1/2 trial of tivozanib in
      combination with durvalumab is currently underway. Trial

AB  - Background: Combining immune-checkpoint inhibitors with
      chemotherapy yielded an increased response rates in patients with
      metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). Therefore, we
      evaluated the addition of durvalumab to standard neoadjuvant
      chemotherapy (NACT) in primary TNBC. <br/>Patients and Methods:
      GeparNuevo is a randomised phase II double-blind placebo-controlled
      study randomising patients with TNBC to durvalumab or placebo given
      every 4 weeks in addition to nab-paclitaxel followed by standard EC.
      In the window-phase durvalumab/placebo alone was given 2 weeks
      before start of nab-paclitaxel. Randomisation was stratified by
      stromal tumour-infiltrating lymphocyte (sTILs). Patients with
      primary cT1b-cT4a-d disease, centrally confirmed TNBC and sTILs were
      included. Primary objective was pathological complete response (pCR)
      (ypT0 ypN0). <br/>Result(s): A total of 174 patients were
      randomised, 117 participated in the window-phase. Median age was
      49.5 years (range 23-76); 47 patients (27%) were younger than 40
      years; 113 (65%) had stage >=IIA disease, 25 (14%) high sTILs, 138
      of 158 (87%) were PD-L1-positive. pCR rate with durvalumab was 53.4%

      0.224). Durvalumab effect was seen only in the window cohort (pCR
      61.0% versus 41.4%, OR = 2.22, 95% CI 1.06-4.64, P = 0.035;
      interaction P = 0.048). In both arms, significantly increased pCR (P
      < 0.01) were observed with higher sTILs. There was a trend for
      increased pCR rates in PD-L1-positive tumours, which was significant
      for PD-L1-tumour cell in durvalumab (P = 0.045) and for PD-L1-immune
      cell in placebo arm (P = 0.040). The most common immune-related
      adverse events were thyroid dysfunction any grade in 47%.
      <br/>Conclusion(s): Our results suggest that the addition of
      durvalumab to anthracycline-/taxane-based NACT increases pCR rate
      particularly in patients treated with durvalumab alone before start
      of chemotherapy. Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov number:

AB  - PURPOSE: Single-agent PD-1 blockade exhibits limited efficacy
      in epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC). We evaluated ipilimumab plus
      nivolumab compared with nivolumab alone in women with persistent or
      recurrent EOC. <br/>METHOD(S): Eligibility criteria included
      measurable disease, 1-3 prior regimens, and platinum-free interval
      (PFI) < 12 months. Participants were randomly allocated to
      intravenous nivolumab (every 2 weeks) or induction with nivolumab
      plus ipilimumab for 4 doses (every 3 weeks), followed by
      every-2-week maintenance nivolumab for a maximum of 42 doses. The
      primary null hypothesis was equal probability of objective response
      within 6 months of random allocation in each arm. <br/>RESULT(S):
      One hundred patients were allocated to receive either nivolumab (n =
      49), or nivolumab plus ipilimumab (n = 51), with PFI of < 6 months
      in 62%. Six (12.2%) responses occurred within 6 months in the
      nivolumab group and 16 (31.4%) in the nivolumab plus ipilimumab
      group (odds ratio, 3.28; 85% CI, 1.54 to infinity; P = .034). The
      median progression-free survival (PFS) was 2 and 3.9 months in the
      nivolumab and nivolumab plus ipilimumab groups, respectively, with a
      PFI-stratified hazard ratio of 0.53 (95% CI, 0.34 to 0.82); the
      respective hazard ratio for death was 0.79 (95% CI, 0.44 to 1.42).
      Grade >= 3 related adverse events occurred in 33% of patients in the
      nivolumab group and 49% in the combination group, with no
      treatment-related deaths. PD-L1 expression was not significantly
      associated with response in either treatment group.
      <br/>CONCLUSION(S): Compared with nivolumab alone, the combination
      of nivolumab and ipilimumab in EOC resulted in superior response
      rate and longer, albeit limited, PFS, with toxicity of the
      combination regimen comparable to prior reports. Additional
      combination studies to enhance durability of the dual regimen are
      warranted.

AB  - Atezolizumab (Tecentriq<sup></sup>), an immune checkpoint
      inhibitor against programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1), is the first
      immunotherapy agent to be approved (for use in combination with
      nab-paclitaxel) in the USA, the EU (as first-line) and Japan for the
      treatment of advanced triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). Approval
      was based on the results of the phase III IMpassion130 trial in
      patients with unresectable locally advanced or metastatic TNBC, in
      which atezolizumab plus nab-paclitaxel significantly prolonged
      progression-free survival (PFS) when compared to placebo plus
      nab-paclitaxel in the intent-to-treat (ITT) population and the
      PD-L1+ subgroup. Statistically significant overall survival (OS)
      benefits were not seen in two interim analyses and final OS data are
      awaited. The tolerability and safety profile of atezolizumab plus
      nab-paclitaxel was consistent with those of each individual drug.
      The most common treatment-related adverse events included
      neutropenia, peripheral neuropathy and reduced neutrophil count.
      Adverse events of special interest occurred with higher frequency in
      patients who received atezolizumab plus nab-paclitaxel than placebo
      plus nab-paclitaxel, and were mostly immune-related (e.g.
      immune-related rash, hypothyroidism and hepatitis). Health-related
      quality of life was not significantly impacted by the addition of
      atezolizumab to nab-paclitaxel therapy. Thus, atezolizumab plus
      nab-paclitaxel is a useful immunochemotherapy option for patients
      with unresectable locally advanced or metastatic TNBC, including
      those whose tumours have PD-L1 expression >= 1%.<br/>Copyright

AB  - Importance: Because of socioeconomic factors, many patients
      with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) do not receive
      immunotherapy in the first-line setting. It is unknown if the
      combination of immunotherapy with chemotherapy can provide clinical
      benefits in immunotherapy-naive patients with disease progression
      after treatment with platinum-based chemotherapy. <br/>Objective(s):
      To evaluate the safety and efficacy of the combination of
      pembrolizumab plus docetaxel in patients with previously treated
      advanced NSCLC following platinum-based chemotherapy regardless of
      EGFR variants or programmed cell death ligand 1 status. <br/>Design,
      Setting, and Participant(s): The Pembrolizumab Plus Docetaxel for
      Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (PROLUNG) trial randomized 78
      patients with histologically confirmed advanced NSCLC in a 1:1 ratio
      to receive either pembrolizumab plus docetaxel or docetaxel alone
      from December 2016 through May 2019. <br/>Intervention(s): The
      experimental arm received docetaxel on day 1 (75 mg/m<sup>2</sup>)
      plus pembrolizumab on day 8 (200 mg) every 3 weeks for up to 6
      cycles followed by pembrolizumab maintenance until progression or
      unacceptable toxic effects. The control arm received docetaxel
      monotherapy. <br/>Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary end point
      was overall response rate (ORR). Secondary end points included
      progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival, and safety.
      <br/>Result(s): Among 78 recruited patients, 32 (41%) were men, 34
      (44%) were never smokers, and 25 (32%) had an EGFR/ALK alteration.
      Forty patients were allocated to receive pembrolizumab plus
      docetaxel, and 38 were allocated to receive docetaxel. A
      statistically significant difference in ORR, assessed by an
      independent reviewer, was found in patients receiving pembrolizumab
      plus docetaxel vs patients receiving docetaxel (42.5% vs 15.8%; odds
      ratio, 3.94; 95% CI, 1.34-11.54; P =.01). Patients without EGFR
      variations had a considerable difference in ORR of 35.7% vs 12.0% (P
      =.06), whereas patients with EGFR variations had an ORR of 58.3% vs
      23.1% (P =.14). Overall, PFS was longer in patients who received
      pembrolizumab plus docetaxel (9.5 months; 95% CI, 4.2-not reached)
      than in patients who received docetaxel (3.9 months; 95% CI,
      3.2-5.7) (hazard ratio, 0.24; 95% CI, 0.13-0.46; P <.001). For
      patients without variations, PFS was 9.5 months (95% CI, 3.9-not
      reached) vs 4.1 months (95% CI, 3.5-5.3) (P <.001), whereas in
      patients with EGFR variations, PFS was 6.8 months (95% CI, 6.2-not
      reached) vs 3.5 months (95% CI, 2.3-6.2) (P =.04). In terms of
      safety, 23% (9 of 40) vs 5% (2 of 38) of patients experienced grade
      1 to 2 pneumonitis in the pembrolizumab plus docetaxel and docetaxel
      arms, respectively (P =.03), while 28% (11 of 40) vs 3% (1 of 38)
      experienced any-grade hypothyroidism (P =.002). No new safety
      signals were identified. <br/>Conclusions and Relevance: In this
      phase 2 study, the combination of pembrolizumab plus docetaxel was
      well tolerated and substantially improved ORR and PFS in patients
      with advanced NSCLC who had previous progression after
      platinum-based chemotherapy, including NSCLC with EGFR variations.

AB  - Background: Immune checkpoint inhibitors targeting PD-1 have
      shown clinical benefit in adults with cancer, but data on these
      drugs in children are scarce. We did a phase 1-2 study of nivolumab,
      a PD-1 blocking monoclonal antibody, to determine its safety,
      pharmacokinetics, and antitumour activity in children and young
      adults with recurrent or refractory non-CNS solid tumours or
      lymphoma. <br/>Method(s): We did a multicentre, open-label,
      single-arm, dose-confirmation and dose-expansion, phase 1-2 trial in
      23 hospitals in the USA. Eligible patients for part A
      (dose-confirmation phase) of the study were aged 1-18 years with
      solid tumours with measurable or evaluable disease (by Response
      Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors [RECIST] version 1.1) regardless
      of histology. Eligible patients for part B (dose-expansion phase)
      were aged 1-30 years with measurable disease (by RECIST criteria) in
      the following disease cohorts: rhabdomyosarcoma, Ewing sarcoma,
      osteosarcoma, neuroblastoma, Hodgkin lymphoma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma,
      and melanoma. Patients in part A and were given nivolumab 3 mg/kg
      intravenously over 60 min on days 1 and 15 of a 28-day cycle in a
      rolling 6 study design with de-escalation upon dose-limiting
      toxicities to establish the recommended phase 2 dose. Patients in
      part B were given the recommended phase 2 dose. The primary outcomes
      were the tolerability, systemic exposure, maximum tolerated dose,
      and the antitumour activity of nivolumab at the adult recommended
      dose in children and young adults. This trial is registered with
      ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02304458, with follow-up ongoing and is
      closed to new participants. <br/>Finding(s): 85 patients were
      enrolled between Feb 22, 2015, and Dec 31, 2018, and 75 patients
      were fully evaluable for toxicity. Median follow-up was 30 days (IQR
      27-83). In part A, 13 patients were enrolled and 12 were evaluable
      for toxicity. There were no dose de-escalations or dose-limiting
      toxicities and nivolumab 3 mg/kg was confirmed as the paediatric
      recommended phase 2. 72 patients were enrolled in part B and 63 were
      evaluable for toxicity. Five (7%) patients in part B had
      dose-limiting toxicities. The most common overall toxicity was
      anaemia (35 [47%] of 75 patients; five patients had grade 3 or grade
      4) and non-haematological toxicity was fatigue (28 [37%] patients;
      none had grade 3 or grade 4). Responses were observed in patients
      with lymphoma (three [30%] of ten with Hodgkin lymphoma and one
      [10%] of ten with non-Hodgkin lymphoma; all responders had PD-L1
      expression). Objective responses were not observed in other tumour
      types. <br/>Interpretation(s): Nivolumab was safe and well tolerated
      in children and young adults and showed clinical activity in
      lymphoma. Nivolumab showed no significant single-agent activity in
      the common paediatric solid tumours. This study defines the
      recommended phase 2 dose and establishes a favourable safety profile
      for nivolumab in children and young adults, which can serve as the
      basis for its potential study in combinatorial regimens for
      childhood cancer. <br/>Funding(s): Bristol-Myers Squibb, Children's

AB  - Background: Novel second-line treatments are needed for
      patients with advanced urothelial cancer (UC). Interim analysis of
      the phase III KEYNOTE-045 study showed a superior overall survival
      (OS) benefit of pembrolizumab, a programmed death 1 inhibitor,
      versus chemotherapy in patients with advanced UC that progressed on
      platinum-based chemotherapy. Here we report the long-term safety and
      efficacy outcomes of KEYNOTE-045. <br/>Patients and Methods: Adult
      patients with histologically/cytologically confirmed UC whose
      disease progressed after first-line, platinum-containing
      chemotherapy were enrolled. Patients were randomly assigned 1 : 1 to
      receive pembrolizumab [200 mg every 3 weeks (Q3W)] or investigator's
      choice of paclitaxel (175 mg/m<sup>2</sup> Q3W), docetaxel (75
      mg/m<sup>2</sup> Q3W), or vinflunine (320 mg/m<sup>2</sup> Q3W).
      Primary end points were OS and progression-free survival (PFS) per
      Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, version 1.1 (RECIST
      v1.1) by blinded independent central radiology review (BICR). A key
      secondary end point was objective response rate per RECIST v1.1 by
      BICR. <br/>Result(s): A total of 542 patients were enrolled
      (pembrolizumab, n = 270; chemotherapy, n = 272). Median follow-up as
      of 26 October 2017 was 27.7 months. Median 1- and 2-year OS rates
      were higher with pembrolizumab (44.2% and 26.9%, respectively) than
      chemotherapy (29.8% and 14.3%, respectively). PFS rates did not
      differ between treatment arms; however, 1- and 2-year PFS rates were
      higher with pembrolizumab. The objective response rate was also
      higher with pembrolizumab (21.1% versus 11.0%). Median duration of
      response to pembrolizumab was not reached (range 1.6+ to 30.0+
      months) versus chemotherapy (4.4 months; range 1.4+ to 29.9+
      months). Pembrolizumab had lower rates of any grade (62.0% versus

AB  - Objectives: There is uncertainty whether older patients derive
      a similar benefit from immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) as younger
      patients. We performed a meta-analysis of ICI trials in advanced
      cancers to better estimate treatment benefit in the older
      population. <br/>Material(s) and Method(s): We performed an
      electronic search for randomized trials of ICI, either as
      monotherapy or in combination with other agents. Hazard ratios (HR)
      for subgroups defined by different age cut-offs were extracted.
      Pooled overall survival (OS) treatment estimates were calculated
      using the inverse variance weighted method. <br/>Result(s): In
      nineteen trials comparing ICI monotherapy versus non-ICI treatment,
      there was no significant treatment-age interaction (age >= 65 years:
      N = 6064, HR 0.73; age < 65 years: N = 7250, HR 0.79; P-interaction
      = 0.27). Findings were similar at older age cut-offs of 70 years
      (age >= 70 years: N = 433, HR = 0.93; age < 70 years: N = 169, HR =
      0.95; P-interaction = 0.91) and 75 years (age >= 75 years: N = 139,
      HR = 0.75; age < 75 years: N = 1133, HR = 0.61; P-interaction =
      0.72) respectively, and for trials of ICI combination therapy.
      <br/>Conclusion(s): ICI therapy improves OS in both younger and
      older patients with advanced cancers, and the magnitude of
      improvement does not depend on age. Patient selection for ICI
      therapy should be done based on performance status and adequate
      organ function independently of age.<br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2019

AB  - PURPOSE: Platinum-based chemotherapy for first-line treatment
      of metastatic urothelial cancer is typically administered for a
      fixed duration followed by observation until progression. "Switch
      maintenance" therapy with PD-1 blockade at the time of chemotherapy
      cessation may be attractive for mechanistic and pragmatic reasons.
      <br/>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with metastatic urothelial
      cancer achieving at least stable disease on first-line
      platinum-based chemotherapy were enrolled. Patients were randomly
      assigned double-blind 1:1 to switch maintenance pembrolizumab 200 mg
      intravenously once every 3 weeks versus placebo for up to 24 months.
      Patients with disease progression on placebo could cross over to
      pembrolizumab. The primary objective was to determine the
      progression-free survival. Secondary objectives included determining
      overall survival as well as treatment outcomes according to PD-L1
      combined positive score (CPS). <br/>RESULT(S): Between December 2015
      and November 2018, 108 patients were randomly assigned to
      pembrolizumab (n = 55) or placebo (n = 53). The objective response
      rate was 23% with pembrolizumab and 10% with placebo.
      Treatment-emergent grade 3-4 adverse events occurred in 59%
      receiving pembrolizumab and 38% of patients receiving placebo.
      Progression-free survival was significantly longer with maintenance
      pembrolizumab versus placebo (5.4 months [95% CI, 3.1 to 7.3 months]
      v 3.0 months [95% CI; 2.7 to 5.5 months]; hazard ratio, 0.65;
      log-rank P = .04; maximum efficiency robust test P = .039). Median
      overall survival was 22 months (95% CI, 12.9 months to not reached)
      with pembrolizumab and 18.7 months (95% CI, 11.4 months to not
      reached) with placebo. There was no significant interaction between
      PD-L1 CPS >= 10 and treatment arm for progression-free survival or
      overall survival. <br/>CONCLUSION(S): Switch maintenance
      pembrolizumab leads to additional objective responses in patients
      achieving at least stable disease with first-line platinum-based
      chemotherapy and prolongs progression-free survival in patients with
      metastatic urothelial cancer.

AB  - Introduction: In the last few years, monoclonal antibodies
      have rapidly modified the therapeutic strategies for treating
      patients with multiple myeloma. Areas covered: In this review, the
      most recent literature data regarding indications for which
      monoclonal antibodies are currently or will be shortly approved as
      salvage therapies in relapsed/refractory myeloma are discussed. In
      particular, updated results until March 22, 2020 of antibodies
      directed against CD38 (daratumumab and isatuximab), SLAMF7
      (elotuzumab), BCMA (GSK2857916/belantamab mafodotin), and PD-1/PD-1
      L axis (nivolumab and pembrolizumab) will be analyzed in detail.
      Expert opinion: Monoclonal antibodies represent a new, very
      effective approach that will open novel and dynamic treatment
      scenarios for myeloma patients in the coming years. Optimal
      positioning and selection of different antibodies that are or will
      be soon available, appropriate combinations and careful evaluation
      of possible new toxicities should be considered in the future
      management of these patients.<br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2020, &#xa9; 2020

AB  - Importance: Checkpoint inhibitors targeting programmed cell
      death 1 or its ligand (PD-L1) as monotherapies or in combination
      with anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 have shown
      clinical activity in patients with metastatic non-small cell lung
      cancer. <br/>Objective(s): To compare durvalumab, with or without
      tremelimumab, with chemotherapy as a first-line treatment for
      patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer. <br/>Design,
      Setting, and Participant(s): This open-label, phase 3 randomized
      clinical trial (MYSTIC) was conducted at 203 cancer treatment
      centers in 17 countries. Patients with treatment-naive, metastatic
      non-small cell lung cancer who had no sensitizing EGFR or ALK
      genetic alterations were randomized to receive treatment with
      durvalumab, durvalumab plus tremelimumab, or chemotherapy. Data were
      collected from July 21, 2015, to October 30, 2018.
      <br/>Intervention(s): Patients were randomized (1:1:1) to receive
      treatment with durvalumab (20 mg/kg every 4 weeks), durvalumab (20
      mg/kg every 4 weeks) plus tremelimumab (1 mg/kg every 4 weeks, up to
      4 doses), or platinum-based doublet chemotherapy. <br/>Main Outcomes
      and Measures: The primary end points, assessed in patients with
      >=25% of tumor cells expressing PD-L1, were overall survival (OS)
      for durvalumab vs chemotherapy, and OS and progression-free survival
      (PFS) for durvalumab plus tremelimumab vs chemotherapy. Analysis of
      blood tumor mutational burden (bTMB) was exploratory.
      <br/>Result(s): Between July 21, 2015, and June 8, 2016, 1118
      patients were randomized. Baseline demographic and disease
      characteristics were balanced between treatment groups. Among 488
      patients with >=25% of tumor cells expressing PD-L1, median OS was
      16.3 months (95% CI, 12.2-20.8) with durvalumab vs 12.9 months (95%
      CI, 10.5-15.0) with chemotherapy (hazard ratio [HR], 0.76; 97.54%
      CI, 0.56-1.02; P =.04 [nonsignificant]). Median OS was 11.9 months
      (95% CI, 9.0-17.7) with durvalumab plus tremelimumab (HR vs
      chemotherapy, 0.85; 98.77% CI, 0.61-1.17; P =.20). Median PFS was
      3.9 months (95% CI, 2.8-5.0) with durvalumab plus tremelimumab vs
      5.4 months (95% CI, 4.6-5.8) with chemotherapy (HR, 1.05; 99.5% CI,
      0.72-1.53; P =.71). Among 809 patients with evaluable bTMB, those
      with a bTMB >=20 mutations per megabase showed improved OS for
      durvalumab plus tremelimumab vs chemotherapy (median OS, 21.9 months
      [95% CI, 11.4-32.8] vs 10.0 months [95% CI, 8.1-11.7]; HR, 0.49; 95%
      CI, 0.32-0.74). Treatment-related adverse events of grade 3 or
      higher occurred in 55 (14.9%) of 369 patients who received treatment
      with durvalumab, 85 (22.9%) of 371 patients who received treatment
      with durvalumab plus tremelimumab, and 119 (33.8%) of 352 patients
      who received treatment with chemotherapy. These adverse events led
      to death in 2 (0.5%), 6 (1.6%), and 3 (0.9%) patients, respectively.
      <br/>Conclusions and Relevance: The phase 3 MYSTIC study did not
      meet its primary end points of improved OS with durvalumab vs
      chemotherapy or improved OS or PFS with durvalumab plus tremelimumab
      vs chemotherapy in patients with >=25% of tumor cells expressing
      PD-L1. Exploratory analyses identified a bTMB threshold of >=20
      mutations per megabase for optimal OS benefit with durvalumab plus
      tremelimumab. Trial Registration: ClinicalT rials.gov Identifier:

AB  - Importance: Therapies targeting the programmed cell death 1
      (PD-1) receptor or its ligand (PD-L1), such as the humanized
      monoclonal antibody durvalumab, have shown durable clinical
      responses in several tumor types. However, concerns about the safety
      and feasibility of PD-1/PD-L1 blockade in HIV-1-infected individuals
      have led to the exclusion of these patients from clinical trials on
      cancer immunotherapies. <br/>Objective(s): To evaluate the
      feasibility and safety of durvalumab treatment in patients with
      advanced cancer and virologically controlled HIV-1 infection.
      <br/>Design, Setting, and Participant(s): The DURVAST study was a
      nonrandomized, open-label, phase 2 clinical trial in patients with
      any solid tumor type in which anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 antibodies
      have approved indications or for which there are data of antitumoral
      activity with no other available curative therapy. All patients had
      basal undetectable plasma viremia while undergoing combination
      antiretroviral therapy. <br/>Intervention(s): Treatment consisted of
      intravenous infusion of durvalumab (1500 mg every 4 weeks) until
      disease progression or unacceptable toxic effects. <br/>Main
      Outcomes and Measures: Adverse events were graded with the use of
      the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for
      Adverse Events, version 4.03. Tumor response was evaluated using the
      Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1.
      <br/>Result(s): A total of 20 HIV-1-infected patients with advanced
      cancer were enrolled; 16 (80%) were male, the median (range) age was
      54 (30-73) years, and 12 (60%) had progressed with previous cancer
      treatment lines. A median (range) of 4 (1-16) cycles of durvalumab
      were administered. Drug-related adverse events were observed in 50%
      of patients, and all were grade 1 and 2 (mainly diarrhea, asthenia,
      and arthromyalgia). Four of 16 response-evaluable patients (25%) had
      a partial response. Five patients (31%) had stable disease,
      including 4 with durable stable disease (disease control rate of
      50%). CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell counts and plasma
      HIV-1 viremia remained stable throughout the study. <br/>Conclusions
      and Relevance: Durvalumab treatment was feasible and safe in
      HIV-1-infected patients with cancer receiving combination
      antiretroviral therapy. HIV-1-infected patients on suppressive
      antiretroviral therapy with advanced cancer should have access to
      cancer immunotherapy treatments. Trial Registration:
