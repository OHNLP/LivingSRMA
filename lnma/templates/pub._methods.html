        <p>Proposed model for living network meta-analysis system consists of five layers: application layer, shared module layer, core service layer, middleware layer, and storage layer respectively. In the application layer, there are 6 applications to provide the graphical user interface (GUI) to different users.  Each application is designed for a specific task, such as monitoring the latest updates in studies (Study Watcher), selecting studies for further analysis (Study Screener), annotating outcomes from study texts (Data Collector), and conducting the  meta-analysis (pairwise or network meta-analysis) on selected studies (Data Analyzer); To support these functions, applications are built upon customized GUI modules and third party frontend packages, which are listed in the shared module layer; In the core service layer, the user operations in each application are sent to the meta-analysis application programming interface (API) and processed by specific service module, which is used to execute commands or packages in the middleware layer. For example, the outcome analysis service in the project management converts the requests from the data analyzer application by researchers to R script by Python network packages, then this service gets the results of the R script and saves into database; In the storage layer, all the data used in the system, including the structured meta data of projects and studies, semi-structured user annotation data, and free-text data of study PDF files, will be formatted as defined in our meta-analysis data standard and be saved in different place according to its characteristics.</p>
